            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>es had obſerved to have paſſed through more then 70 times 7 fires in that hot Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>This Male-contented Opinion and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, was firſt vented in ſecret whiſpering
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65909:4"/>and murmuring againſt the Government, which amounted in ſhort time after, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conventicles and Meetings of the diſſatisfied Brethren, as they were humbly pleaſed to term themſelves, into ſundry Invectives and publick Expoſtulations with the Queen, her Councils and Parliaments, ſo that the Party grew ſo formidable, that particular Lawes were made againſt them, and the aforeſaid <hi>Hacket</hi> thereupon execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>For a while after this Juſtice, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſlunk into Corners, and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Dens and Retreats of their own ſhame, till the Coming in of King <hi>James,</hi> towards whom they aſſumed, out of ſome confidence of his preſent advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this Crown, to obtrude the ſame irreverend <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> complaining among other things, chiefly of the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and of the extraordinary Power of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in reſtrayning the Violence and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Libelling and pragmatical Books and Lectures, whoſe main Deſign and aim was the ſame with the Complices of <hi>Corah, Ye Sons of Levi take too much upon you,</hi> when their Conſpiracy was <hi>to take all;</hi> a Truth moſt lamentably confirmed in theſe out Late Reforming Times.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65909:5"/>
            <p> For from that Conference that King vouchſafed their impertinencies, at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court</hi> (where his Learning had the good Fortune of reducing and reclaiming one of their moſt able, but ingenuou Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, by name, D. <hi>Reynolds</hi>) they never deſiſted from underminining the Policy and Government of the Kingdome. Nor was that wiſe King unſenſible of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine waies and Proceedings, but yet was loath to diſcover ſuch a fear of them, as might render them confident and bold, to attempt any thing.

            <p>The Lenity and good Nature of his Son and Succeſſor, <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, afforded them the Advantages they had long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and waited for.

            <p>Indeed the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility were mainly concerned: for by an Act of Revocation, paſſed in that Kings Reign, the Church-Lands were to revert again to the right Proprietors, which the Nobility were then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65909:6"/>poſſeſſed of, and though the King after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards out of ſome prudent Conſiderations, had indulged them a longer tenure, yet, as there is no ſecurity ſafe enough to a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous mind, they could not rely on that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſo that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels fought for that they had ſacrilegiouſly got, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebel for what ſacrilegiouſly he ſhould get.</p>
            <p>The Event of that unlucky War, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preparations to it, ſoon inflated and puſt up the Non-Conformiſt in <hi>England,</hi> the Quarrel (as the Grave Lecturers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and impoſed on the people) being thought to be the ſame, againſt Biſhops, againſt the Liturgy, againſt Ceremonies, and ſuch like; but it was clearly againſt the Biſhops-Lands, againſt Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and againſt the indiſpenſable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a good Conſcience, things more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to theſe ſtrict Diſciplinarians, then a Reverend Decency in holy Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</p>
            <p>Their way being thus made (the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Providence of God) all hands were ſet to work to demoliſh and throw down that goodly ſtructure and Fabrick of Government, under which this Nation had ſo long flouriſhed upon the Support and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For a Parliament being called in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1640, with as much Clamour, as Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, did theſe Factious Incendiaries of the Puritan Party, affront and aſſault the Members of both Houſes, thruſting their Demands into the Two Houſes, under the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65909:7"/>Title of Petitions, being backt with armed Force and Violence; ſeveral tumultuous Rabbles came ſwarming down to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> by the Kings Gates at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Boats and Barges, armed likewiſe, by water; obtruding their unknown Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichio's and conceits upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many of whom, were ſo far from checking or reſiſting ſo dangerous a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which had overflowed the Banks of either Modeſty, Loyalty or Chriſtianity, that they rather abetted, ſided with, and countenanced thoſe treaſonable Attempts, nor did theſe Tumults ceaſe, till the King was forced to abandon his own Houſe, to ſave Himſelf, His Honour and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>But before they began this great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon a whole Order ſo rooted and ſetled by the Laws, their Dignities and Revenues, ſo reverenced and eſteemed for their individual Perſons and Worth, by all men of Wiſdom and Honour, ſo ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended by the King and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (which at firſt they durſt not grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with) his chief Miniſters of State, his Judges, and for the greateſt part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; they caſt about how to effect their Tragical Intentions and Deſigns, another

            <p>The pretended Crime was a dutiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Fifth Commandment, which lay in the way to their deſigned ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe; the Faction was engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Power or Authority but that of their own Wils, and could allow no ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences to the Second Table, which having prophaned in the firſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Command, they eaſily contrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and abrogated the reſt, in murdering, plundering, and adulterating the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, perjuring and inſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Amongſt the firſt of theſe, was the Earl of <hi>Sirafford,</hi> a Perſon, whom the Faction knew to be a firm Friend to the Biſhops, and a great Lover of that Sacred Function and Order, one that had manifeſted that Affection to them, in his Adminiſtration of the Government of <hi>Ireland;</hi> a wiſe, yea the wiſeſt Subject in the Kingdom, who

            <p>The King had ſummoned this very Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by his Advice, concurring with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Council, having called him out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſomtime before, to aſſiſt him in the War, againſt the aforeſaid Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Scots,</hi> as L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This was the firſt Parliament wherein the Faction was predominant; not that their <hi>particular number</hi> made them ſo, but they cloſed with all Intereſts, that were any way offended at the Government; and ſome well-meaning men there were too, that were led by the Noſe by theſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) good Patriots; but having by theſe means got the Vote of the Commons in their own management, they reſolved, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Soon after he was created Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> he was made alſo Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which Government he exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in policy and good Laws, and careful management in advancing the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue and aſcertaining it for the future, all that went before him.

            <p>The very firſt thing of conſequence done at the firſt Seſſions, was a charge exhibited by the Houſe of Commons againſt this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65909:13"/>Earl, which conſiſted of 28.

            </p>
            <p>His Tryal thereupon <hi>April</hi> 13. enſued, which was done with all ſolemnity, a Court being made for the purpoſe, with ſeats for both Houſes, and a Canopy for the King, with a Terraſſe before it; The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was Lord High Steward; his Accuſers were <hi>Pym, St. Johns, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> Sr. <hi>Walter Earles,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Glyn, May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Stroud,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden, Hambden,</hi> &amp;c. The Lieutenant warded all their blows, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf bravely and learnedly, ſo that there was no hopes of prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his innocence by the Law, before the Lords that were his Judges.</p>
            <p>But the implacable fury of the Houſe of Commons, ſince chey could effect nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65909:13"/>this way, put them upon another, which was to draw up a Bill of Attaindor and preſent it to the Lords, whereby the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact was declared to have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved, and then as to Law that he had incurred the cenſure of Treaſon, the Lords ſtumbled at this way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a path leading to their own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it being a courſe unſuitable to the practice and ſtate of the Kingdom, and their own ſafety, and againſt Common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. To this it was replied by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that if the Lords would not joyn with them in this way, they feared a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might follow, for that the People would not be ſatisfied without Juſtice done upon the Earl, as the Author of all their grievances.</p>
            <p>The Lords ſtood for a while to their firſt determination, and heard the Earl by his Council at their Bar as to matter of Law; this made the Houſe of Commons (though the King in a ſet ſpeech to them, had cleared the Earl, from any deſign of Treaſon or conſulting to any arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor could he concur to puniſh him as a Traitor) the more eager. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Londoners</hi> came down in Tumults, crying Juſtice, and threatning the Lords as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65909:14"/>aforeſaid, ſo that at laſt the ſaid Bill, uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by a Proteſtation, paſſed the whole Houſe of Commons <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> but the Lord <hi>Darby</hi> and one or two more; and preſently after the Houſe of Lords, where were preſent 45, 26 againſt him, and 19 for him, moſt of his friends abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves for fear of the multitude.

            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65909:15"/>
            <p> For neither Statute-Law, nor Common-Law written, that ever I could here of, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it ſo.</p>
            <p>And yet I have been diligent to enquire, (as I believe you think it doth concern me to do.)</p>
            <p>It is hard to be queſtioned for life and honour upon a Law that cannot be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>There is a Rule which I have learned from Sir <hi>Edward Cooke, De non aparenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem ratio:</hi> (Jeſu) where hath this fire lain all this while, ſo many hundred of years, without any ſmoak to diſcover it, till it thus burſt out to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume me and my children; extreme hard in my opinion, that puniſhment ſhould precede promulgation of Law! puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Law ſubſequent to the Acts done.</p>
            <p>Take it into your conſiderations: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is now better to be under no Law at all, but the will of men, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelves under the protection of a Law, as we think, and then be puniſhed for a crime that doth precede the Law: what man can be ſafe, if that be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?</p>
            <p>My Lords, it is hard in another reſpect, that there ſhould be no token ſet upon this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65909:15"/>offence, by which we ſhould know it, no admonition by which we ſhould be aware of it.</p>
            <p>If a man paſſe down the Thames in a Boat, and it be ſplit upon an Anchor, and no booy be ſer, as a token that there is an Anchor there, that party that ows the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, by the Maritine Laws ſhall give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the damage done; but if it were marked out, I muſt come upon my own peril.</p>
            <p>Now where is a mark upon this crime? Where is the token, this is high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>If it be under water, and not above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no humane providence can avail nor prevent my deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Lay aſide all humane wiſdom, and let us reſt upon Divine Revelation, if you will condemn before you forewarn the danger.</p>
            <p>Oh my Lords! may your Lordſhips be pleaſed to give that regard unto the Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>England,</hi> as never to ſuffer our ſelves to be put on thoſe nice points, upon ſuch contractive interpretations; and theſe are where Laws are not clear, or known. If there muſt be a tryal of wits, I do humbly beſeech you, the ſubject and matter may be ſomewhat elſe than the lives and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Peers.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:65909:16"/>
            <p> My Lords, we find that the primitive times, in the progreſſion of the plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles, they brought the Books of curious Arts, and burned them. And ſo likewiſe, as I do conceive, it will be wiſdom and providence in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, for your Poſterity and the whole Kingdom, to caſt from you, into the fire, theſe bloudy and moſt myſterious Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Conſtructive and Arbitrary Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and to betake your ſelves to the plain Letters of the Law and Statute, that telleth us where the crime is, and by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what is, and what is not, ſhews us how to avoid it. And let us not be ambitious, to be more wiſe and learned in the killing Arts, than our Forefathers were.</p>
            <p>It is now full two hundred and forty years ſince ever any man was touched for this alledged crime (to this height) before my ſelf; we have lived happily to our ſelves at home, and we have lived gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the World abroad.</p>
            <p>Let us reſt contented with that our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers left us, and not awaken thoſe ſleepy Lions to our own deſtructions; by raking up a few muſty Records that have lain ſo many Ages by the walls, quite forgotten and neglected.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65909:16"/>
            <p> May your Lordſhips be nobly pleaſed, to add this to thoſe other miſ-fortunes befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len me for my ſins, not for my Treaſons, that a preſident ſhould be derived from me of that diſadvantage (as this will be in the conſequent to the whole Kingdom) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſeriouſly to conſider it, and let not my particular Cauſe be looked upon as you do; though you wound me in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Commonwealth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Gentlemen ſay, that they ſpeak for the Commonwealth, yet in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I indeed ſpeak for it, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and miſchiefs that will hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily fall upon us: for as it is in the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, no man will after know what to do, or ſay for fear.</p>
            <p>Do not put, my Lords, ſo great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties upon the Miniſters of State, that men of wiſdom, honour and vertue, may not with chearfulneſſe and ſafety be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the Publick, if you weigh and meaſure them by grains and ſcruples, the publick affaires of the Kingdom will be laid waſt, and no man will meddle with them, that hath honours, iſſues, or any fortunes to loſe.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I have now troubled you lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than I ſhould have done, were it not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65909:17"/>for the intereſt of thoſe dear pledges a Saint in Heaven left me; I ſhould be loath, my Lords, (there he ſtopped.)</p>
            <p>What I forfeit for my ſelf it is nothing, but that my indiſcretion ſhould forfeit for my child, it even woundeth me deep to the very Soul.</p>
            <p>You will pardon my infirmitie, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I ſhould have ſaid, but I am not able, (and ſighed) therefore let it paſſe.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lords, I have been, by the bleſſing of Almighty God, taught, that the afflictions of this life preſent, are not to be compared to the eternal weight of that glory that ſhall be revealed to us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>And ſo, my Lords, even ſo with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind I do ſubmit my ſelf freely and clearly to your Lordſhips judgments, and whether that Righteous judgment ſhall be to life or death.</p>

               <p>IT is my very great comfort that I have your Lordſhip by me this day, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I have been known to you theſe many years, and I do thank God, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for it that you are here; I ſhould be very glad to obtain ſo much ſilence, as to be heard a few words, but I doubt I ſhall not, the noiſe is ſo great. My Lords, I am come hither by the good will and pleaſure of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to pay that laſt Debt I owe to ſin, which is death, and by the Bleſſing of that God, to riſe again through the Merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to Righteouſneſſe and Life Eternal. [Here he was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle interrupted.]</p>
               <p>My Lords, I am come hither to ſubmit to that Judgment which hath paſſed againſt me; I do it with a very quiet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, I thank God I do freely forgive all the world, a forgiveneſſe that is not ſpoken from the teeth outwards (as they ſay) but from the very heart, I ſpeak it in the preſence of Almighty God, before
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65909:18"/>whom I ſtand, that there is not a diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought ariſing in me towards any man living. I thank God I can ſay it, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, my Conſcience bearing me witneſs, that in all my employment, ſince I had the honour to ſerve his Majeſty, I never had any thing in the purpoſe of my heart, but what tended to the joynt and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual proſperity of King and People; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath been my ill fortune to be miſ-conſtrued.</p>
               <p>I am not the firſt that hath ſuffered in this kind, it is the common portion of us all, while we are in this life, to erre, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment we muſt wait for in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, for here we are very ſubject to be miſ-judged one of another: There is one thing that I deſire to free my ſelf of, and I am very confident (ſpeaking it now with ſo much chearfulneſſe) that I ſhall obtain your Chriſtian Charity in the belief of it. I was ſo far from being againſt Parliaments, that I did alwaies think the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> were the moſt happy Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that any Kingdom or Nation lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the beſt means under God to make the King and People happy.</p>
               <p>For my Death, I here acquit all the world, and beſeech the God of Heaven
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65909:18"/>heartily to forgive them that contrived it, though in the Intentions and Purpoſes of my heart I am not guilty of what I die for: And my Lord Primate, it is a great comfort for me, that his Majeſty conceives me not meriting ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is the utmoſt Execution of this Sentence; I do infinitely rejoyce in this Mercy of his, and I beſeech God return it into his own boſom, that he may find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy when he ſtands moſt in need of it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh this Kingdom all the Proſperity and Happineſſe in the world, I did it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and now dying it is my wiſh; I do moſt humbly recommend this to every one who hears me, and deſire they would ſay their hands upon their hearts, and conſider ſeriouſly whether the beginning of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Reformation of a Kingdom ſhould be written in Letters of Blood: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this when you are at your homes, and let me be never ſo unhappy, as that the laſt drop of my Bloud ſhould riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt any one of you, but I fear you are in a wrong way.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I have but one word m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, and with that I ſhall end. I proſeſſe that I die a true and obedient Son to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I was born, and in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65909:19"/>which I was bred. Peace and Proſperity be ever to it.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected (if it were an Objection worth the anſwering) that I have been enclined to Popery, but I ſay truly from my heart, that from the time that I was one and twenty years of age, to this preſent, going now upon forty nine; I never had in my heart to doubt of this Religion of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Nor ever had any man the boldneſſe to ſuggeſt any ſuch thing to me, to the beſt of my Remembrance: and ſo being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by the Merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> my <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> into whoſe boſom I hope, I ſhall ſhortly be gathered, to thoſe Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which ſhall never have end: I deſire heartily the forgiveneſſe of every man, for any raſh or unadviſed words, or anything done amiſſe: And ſo my Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Farewel: Farewel all the things of this world.</p>
               <p>I deſire that you would be ſilent, and joyn with me in Prayer, and I truſt in God we ſhall all meet and live eternally in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to receive the Accompliſhment of all happineſſe, where every Tear ſhall be wiped away from our eyes, and every ſad thought from our hearts; and ſo, God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65909:19"/>bleſſe this Kingdom, and Jeſus have mercy on my Soul.</p>
               <p>Then turning himſelf about, he ſaluted all the Noble-men; and took a ſolemn leave of all conſiderable Perſons upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, giving them his Hand.</p>
               <p>After that, he ſaid, Gentlemen, I would ſay my Prayers, and entreat you all to pray with me, and for me; then his Chaplain laid the Book of Common-prayer upon the Chair before him, as he kneeled down, on which he prayd almoſt a quarter of an hour, and then as long or longer without the Book, &amp; concluded with the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>Standing up he eſpies his Brother, Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> and cals him to him, ſaying, Brother, we muſt part, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me to my Siſter, and to my Wife, and carry my Bleſſing to my Son, and charge him that he fear God, and continue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Son to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and warn him that he bears no private grudg or revenge toward any man concerning me: &amp; bid him beware that he meddle not with Church-Livings, for that will prove a Moth &amp; canker to him in his Eſtate, and wiſh him to content himſelf to be a Servant to his Country, not aiming at higher preferments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aliter</hi>] To his Son Mr. <hi>Wentworth</hi> he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65909:20"/>commends himſelf, and gives him charge to ſerve his God, to ſubmit to his King with all Faith and Allegiance in things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to the Church in things Spiritual, chargeth him again and again, as he will anſwer it to him in Heaven, never to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Patrimony of the Church, for if he did, it would be a Canker to eat up the reſt of his Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Carry my bleſſing alſo to my Daughter <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Arabella,</hi> charge them to ſerve and fear God, and he will bleſſe them; not forgetting my little Infant, who yet knows neither good nor evil, and cannot ſpeak for it ſelf, God ſpeak for it and bleſſe it; now ſaid he, I have nigh done, one ſtroke will make my Wife husbandleſſe, my dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fatherleſſe, and my poor Servants maſterleſſe, and will ſeparate me from my dear Brother, and all my Friends. But let God be to you, and them all in all.</p>
               <p>After this, going to take off his Doubler, and to make himſelf unready, he ſaid, I thank God I am not afraid of death, nor daunted with any diſcouragement riſing from any fears, but do as chearfully put off my Doublet at this time, as ever I did, when I went to bed; then he put off the Doublet, wound up his hair with his hands,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65909:20"/>and put on a white Cap.</p>
               <p>Then he called, where is the man that is to do this laſt Office? (meaning the Executioner) call him to me: when he came and asked him forgiveneſſe, he told him he forgave him and all the world: then kneeling down by the Block, he went to Prayer again himſelf, the Primate of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> kneeling on the one ſide, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter on the other: To the which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, after Prayer, he turned himſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done Prayer, and ſpoke ſome few words ſoftly, having his hands lifted up, and cloſed with the Miniſters hands.</p>
               <p>Then bowing himſelf to lay his Head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Block, he told the Executioner, that he would firſt lay down his Head to try the fitneſſe of the Block, and take it up again before he would lay it down for good and all: And ſo he did; and before he laid it down again, he told the Executioner, that he would give him warning when to ſtrike by ſtretching forth his hands: And preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laying down his Neck upon the Block, and ſtretching forth his Hands, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſtruck off his Head at one blow, and taking it up in his hand, ſhewed it to all the People, and ſaid, <hi>God ſave the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Body was afterwards embalmed; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65909:21"/>appointed to be carried into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> there to be buried among his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He lift theſe three Inſtructions for his Son in Writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That he ſhould continue ſtill to be brought up under thoſe governors, to whom he had committed him; as being the beſt he could pick out of all thoſe within his knowledge, and that he ſhould not change them, unleſſe they were weary of him; that he ſhould rather want himſelf, then they ſhould want any thing they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He chargeth him as he would anſwer it at the laſt day, not to put himſelf upon any publick Employments till he was Thirty years of age at leaſt: And then if his Prince ſhould call him to Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he ſhould carefully undertake it, to reſtifie his Obedience, and withal to be faithful and ſincere to his Maſter, though he ſhould come to the ſame end that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he ſhould never lay any hand upon any thing that belonged to the Church: He foreſaw that Ruine was like to come upon the Revenues of the Church, and that perhaps they might be ſhared amongſt the Nobility and Gentry.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65909:21"/>But if his Son medled with any of it, he wiſhed the Curſe of God might follow him and all them, to the deſtruction of the <hi>moſt Apoſtolical Church upon Earth.</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Abbots</hi> (his Predeceſſor in that See) Remiſſeneſs and Indifferency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ceremonies uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was the cauſe that the Gangren of Non-conformity was ſo far ſpread, that it was no leſſe trouble, then it raiſed Envy and Obloquy againſt him, to ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn and take order for the ſtrict Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Rites, being every where called Innovations. By this means Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government was by many traduced, many Books and Libels printed againſt them, wherein this Prelate was ſure to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65909:23"/>bear the greateſt burthen, the chief of thoſe Writers were <hi>Baſtwick, Burton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who were afterwards ſentenced in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and ſuffered in the Pillory.</p>
            <p>But that which mainly, and chiefly helped forward his ruine, was his recommending or enjoying the uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church, which was received there with ſo much exaſperation, that it mightily promoted the Wars then in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and deſignment by the Faction in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Soon after Libels were thrown about, full of ſedition, and railing, and ſcurrilous jeers againſt him, which were ſeconded, with a Tumult and rabble of <hi>Londoners</hi> aſſaulting his Houſe at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> for which one of the chief <hi>Thomas Benſted,</hi> was hanged in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fields in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was falſly by ſuch People reported for a Papiſt, whereas what ſtronger proof can be brought for his firmneſſe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, than that Book of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuit, which like a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath beaten all the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Arguments into pieces, an unanſwerable Work, and of which, they will never clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65909:24"/>brag and vapour what they pleaſe. As to his Religion this will ſuffice; for the morality and integrity, conſtant tenour of life, let him be judged by his Diary, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in part by Mr. <hi>Prin.</hi> He had little intermiſſion of his pen or intention of mind againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Enemies have reported of him to the contrary, having before his eyes, as his main aim, the glory and proſperity of this Church, in the right and ſolemn Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>He firſt began the reedifying of that rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and decayed Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> towards the charge whereof, he expended great ſums of money out of his own purſe, and this was reckoned to him as Superſtition, though in the account of ſober and wife men, it was a noble zeal to Gods Houſe. The North-door of that Church he repaired wholly with his own money, the Workmen not knowing whence their wages came.</p>
            <p>In ſum, for theſe joynt Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Piety, Learning, magnificence, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and humility, he is hardly to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralled by any of his Predeceſſors; many have had one or two of them, but wanted the other, in him they were a bright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65909:24"/>whoſe luſtre made this Church glorious, to the envy and wonder of the Nations about us.</p>
            <p>But the time of Gods viſitation being come, for the unfruitfulneſſe, negligence and unthankfulneſſe of the Clergy, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men were raiſed up as ſcourges, to inflict the Divine Judgments. For in the beginning of our diſſentions, as ſoon as the buſineſſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was over, the mad multitude fell a raving and crying no Biſhops, no Biſhops. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1641, and the latter end of 1640, this Reverend Prelate was committed from the Black Rod to the Tower, whither not long after ten more of that ſacred Order, were ſent after him; He continued in the Tower four years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any charge was brought againſt him, though he all along petitioned and deſired the Parliament he might come to his trya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It would trouble <hi>Plutarch,</hi> (if he were alive,) to find out a fit <hi>Parallel</hi> with whom to match him. All therefore I ſhall do at the preſent time, (and tis the laſt publique Office I ſhall do him) is, to lay
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65909:25"/>down the ſtory of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>ſufferings,</hi> together with a view of thoſe <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes</hi> which were ſet on foot, to pluck a few years from a weak old man, and bring him to an unnatural calamitous end. For though that <hi>maxime</hi> in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is moſt true and certain; that <hi>corruptio eſt in inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> that death comes to us in a <hi>moment,</hi> or <hi>in the twinckling of an eye,</hi> as the Scriptures phraſe is; yet are there many <hi>previous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> which make way unto it; all which are comprehended in the name of <hi>death.</hi> And in that latitude of expreſſion do we take the word, in laying down the ſtory of his <hi>death</hi> before you; which being writ out of an honeſt zeal to truth, and a ſincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his name and memory, ſhall either be approved of, or at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
            <p>It was the practice and poſition of the antient <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> (the Predeceſſors and Progenitors of the modern <hi>Puritan</hi>) <hi>occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere quemcun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did never fight more frequent and more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble combats with the <hi>beaſts of Epheſus,</hi> for the promotion of the Goſpel, then he with theſe untractable and fiery ſpirits, who moſt ſeditiouſly oppoſed his religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of ſetling <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> in this Church of <hi>England.</hi> And in this ſtate things ſtood till the year, 1640, in which not only many factious and ſeditious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> made an aſſault by night on his Houſe at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> with an intent to murther him, had they found him there: but the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Scots</hi> declared in a <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that one of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65909:26"/>the chief cauſes which induced them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this Realm, was to remove him from his Majeſty, and bring him to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had deſerved. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their coming hit her, and the great entertainment given them by the faction here, ſhewed plainly that they were not like to be ſent away without their <hi>Errand:</hi> and makes it evident that his ruine was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on in their <hi>ſecret Councils,</hi> before the Parliament was called, or that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſo much by their <hi>will revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> had not long continued, but he is named for an <hi>Incendiary</hi> by the <hi>Scottiſh Commiſſioners,</hi> and thereupon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Treaſon by the <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi> And although no particular <hi>Charge</hi> was brought againſt him, but only a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to prepare it in convenient time; yet was he preſently committed to the cuſtody of the <hi>Gentleman <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and by him kept in durance till the end of <hi>February,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full ten weeks; about which time his Charge was brought unto the <hi>Lords,</hi> but in generals only, and longer time required for particular inſtances. And yet upon this <hi>Lydſord law,</hi> by which they uſed to hang men firſt, and endite them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,) was he committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi>

This was the firſt great breach which was made by <hi>Parliament</hi> in the <hi>liberties</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject; (ſave that their like proceedings with the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> was a preparative unto it;) and was indeed the very <hi>gap,</hi> at which the <hi>ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> under which this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nation hath for many years pined and languiſhed, did break in.

            <p>But yet the malice of his Enemies was not ſo contented. For though ſome of the more moderate (or rather the leſſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) <hi>Lords,</hi> who did not pierce into the depth of the deſign, gave out that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to remove him from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties eare, and to deprive him of his <hi>Arch-Biſhoprick,</hi> (which reſolution notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being taken up before any charge was brought againſt him, was as unjuſt though not ſo cruel, as the others:) yet they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65909:27"/>ſhewed only by this <hi>Ovonture,</hi> that they did reckon without their Hoſts, and might be of the <hi>Court,</hi> perchance, but not of the <hi>Counſel.</hi> The leading and predominant party thought of nothing leſſe, then that he ſhould eſcape with <hi>life,</hi> or go off with <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> Only perhaps they might conceive ſome wicked hopes, that either the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his reſtraint, or the indignitie; and affronts which, day by day, were offer'd to him, would have broken his heart, not formerly accuſtomed to the like oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And then like <hi>Pilate</hi> in the Goſpel they had called for <hi>water, and waſhed their hands before the multitude, and ſaid, that they were innocent of the blood of that righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> thinking that by ſuch wretched <hi>figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves,</hi> they could not only hide their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and <hi>deceive</hi> poor men; but that <hi>God</hi> alſo might be mocked, and his All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eie deluded, to which <hi>all hearts</hi> lye <hi>open, all deſires</hi> are <hi>known, and from which no ſecrets can be hidden.</hi> To this end not content to immute him up within the walls of the <hi>Tower,</hi> they robb him of his <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> ſervants, reſtrain him to two only of his number, and thoſe not to have conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with any others, but in the preſence of his <hi>Warder:</hi> and in concluſion make
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65909:27"/>him a <hi>cloſe Priſoner,</hi> not ſuffering him to go out of his lodging to refreſh himſelf, but in the company of his <hi>Keeper.</hi> And all this while they vex his Soul continually with ſcandalous and infamous Papers, and ſet up factious and ſeditious Preachers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt him in the Pulpit to his very face; ſo to expoſe him to the ſcorn both of boyes and women, who many times ſtood up and turned towards him, to obſerve his countenance, to ſee if any alteration did appear therein. And to the ſame ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, did they diveſt him of his <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal and Epiſcopal</hi> juriſdiction, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it on his inferiour and ſubordinate Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; ſequeſter his rents under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of maintenance for the Kings young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Children (as if his Majeſties Revenues which they had invaded, were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that purpoſe,) convert his Houſe at <hi>Lambeth</hi> into a Priſon, and confiſcate all his coals and fewel to the uſe of their Gaoler; deprive him of his right of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,</hi> and take into their own hands the diſpoſing of all his <hi>Benefices;</hi> ſeize upon all his goods and books which they found at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> and in concluſion, rifle him of his notes and papers, not only ſuch as were of ordinary uſe and obſervation, but ſuch
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65909:28"/>as did concern him in the way of his juſt <hi>defence.</hi> In which they did not any thing from the firſt to the laſt, but in a proud <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance</hi> to the Laws of the Land, which they moſt impudently violated in all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: and more than ſo, they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſtep by ſtep, to this height of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny a whole year almoſt, before they had digeſted their general charge into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Accuſations; or ever called him to his Anſwer in due form of Law.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But God had given him ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both of ſtrength and patience, that theſe afflictions, though moſt great and irkſome, did make no more impreſſions on him, than an Arrow on a rock of <hi>Adamant.</hi> For at his firſt commitment he beſought his God, (as Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> obſerves out of his <hi>Manual of devotions</hi>) to <hi>give him full patience, proportionable comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with whatſoever he ſhould ſend;</hi> and he was heard in that he prayed for. For notwithſtanding that he had fed ſo long on the <hi>bread of carefulneſſe,</hi> and drank the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of affliction:</hi> yet, as the Scripture tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us of the <hi>four Hebrew children, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance appeared fairer and fatter in fleſh, than any of thoſe who ate their portion of the Kings me at, or drank of his wine.</hi> And he was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65909:28"/>wont to ſay to his private friends, that, he <hi>thanked God, he never found more ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in his greateſt liberty, than in the time of that reſtraint.</hi> And certainly it was no wonder that it ſhould be ſo, he being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf of no other <hi>crimes,</hi> which drew that fatal ſtorm upon him, than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>zeal to the honour of God, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the King, and the preſervation of the Church in her peace and patrimony,</hi> as he profeſſed at his death before all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that deſpairing of ſucceſſe in the way intended, his Enemies fell upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but more deſperate courſe, which was to ſhip him for <hi>New-England,</hi> and make him ſubject to the inſolencies of <hi>Wels</hi> and <hi>Peters,</hi> two notorious <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> But this being put to the queſtion in the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> was rejected by the <hi>major</hi> part: not out of pity to his age, or conſideration of his quality, nor in reſpect unto the Laws ſo often violated; but to preſerve him yet a while, as a ſtale or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, wherewith to cheat the <hi>Citizens</hi> of ſome further ſums, and to invite the <hi>Scots</hi> to a new invaſion, when their occaſion ſo required. For it was little doubted by diſcerning men, but that the <hi>Scots,</hi> who made their firſt invaſion on a probable hope
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65909:29"/>of ſequeſtring the Lord Arch-biſhop and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> from His Majeſties Counſels; and ſped it ſo well in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that they were recompenſed already with the death of the one, would eaſily be tempted to a ſecond journey, upon aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be glutted with the blood of the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And this appears more plain and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, in that about the coming on of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which was in the middeſt of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 1643. they did again revive the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which had long lain <hi>dormant;</hi> cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Articles,</hi> which they had framed in maintenance of their former <hi>Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be put in Print about that time, as is apparent by the <hi>Teſt</hi> of <hi>John Brown</hi> their Clerk, dated the 17 of that moneth. And as the <hi>Scots</hi> advanced or ſlackned in their <hi>marches</hi> Southward, ſo did they either quicken or retard the work: till hearing of the great ſucceſſes which they had in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> they gave command to Maſter <hi>Pryn to proſecute the charge againſt him, and bring him to his long expected trial;</hi> as he reports it of himſelf, who, having rifled him of his Papers, and thereby robbed him of thoſe helps, which he had purpoſely reſerved for his juſt defence; and having perſonal
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65909:29"/>quarrels of his own to revenge upon him, was thought to be the fitteſt <hi>blood-hound</hi> in the whole kennel, to purſue the ſcent. And now there was no talk but of quick diſpatch. When <hi>hatred</hi> doth accuſe, and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> proſecute, and prejudice and <hi>prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſit upon the <hi>Bench,</hi> God help the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; There's nothing but a miracle can preſerve him then. And ſo it proved in the event. They called him after to the <hi>Bar,</hi> both before and after, cauſed a ſtrict inquiſition to be made into all his actions: they <hi>winnowed</hi> him like <hi>wheat,</hi> and <hi>ſifted</hi> him to the very bran, (which was you know the Devils office;) they had againſt him all advantages of power and malice, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes at hand upon all occaſions: but ſtill they found his anſwers and his reſolutions of ſo good a temper, his innocence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of ſo bright a die, that as they knew not how to diſmiſſe him with credit, ſo neither could they find a way to condemn him with Juſtice. And though their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences could tell them, that he had done nothing which deſerved either <hi>death</hi> or <hi>bonds;</hi> yet either to reward or oblige the <hi>Scots,</hi> who would not think themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his head was on, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to bring him to a ſpeedy end. Only
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65909:30"/>they did deſire, if poſſible, to lay the <hi>Odium</hi> of the murther upon the common People. And therefore Serjeant <hi>Wilde</hi> in a ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, having aggravated his ſuppoſed offences to the higheſt pitch, concluded thus, that <hi>he was guilty of ſo many and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious treaſons, ſo evidently deſtructive to the Commonwealth, that he marvelled the People did not tear him in pieces as he paſsed between his barge, and the Parliament Houſes.</hi> Which barbarous and bloudy project, when it would not take, and that though many of the Rabble did deſire his death, yet none would be the executioner; they then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome of their moſt malicious and moſt active inſtruments, to go from door to door, and from man to man, to get hands againſt him; and ſo petition thoſe to haſten his condemnation, which muſt, forſooth, be forced to their own deſires: (whereof, and of the <hi>Magiſtrates ſtanding ſtill, and ſuffering them to proceed</hi> without any check, he gave them a <hi>memento</hi> in his dying Speech.) This being obtained, the buſineſſe was purſued with ſuch heat and violence, that by the beginning of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> it was made ready for a Sentence; which ſome conceived would have been given in the Kings Bench, and that their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65909:30"/>proofs (ſuch as they were) being fully ripened, he ſhould have been put over to a <hi>Middleſex Jury.</hi> But they were only ſome poor Ignorants which conceived ſo of it. The leading members of the plot thought of no ſuch matter; and to ſay truth, it did concern them highly not to go that way. For though there was no queſtion to be made at all, but that they could have packed a <hi>Jury</hi> to have found the Bill; yet by a clauſe in the <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> they had bound the Judges not to declare their facts for Treaſon in the time to come, for which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed that Heroick Peer. And therefore it was done with great care and caution to proceed by Ordinance, and vote him guilty firſt in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; in which being parties, witneſſes, and Judges too, they were aſſured to paſſe it as they would themſelves, which was done accordingly, about the 20 of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet the buſineſſe was not done, for the Lords ſtuck at it. Some of which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not extinguiſhed all the ſparks of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, did by the light thereof diſcover the injuſtice of ſo foul a practice; together with the danger might befal themſelves,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65909:31"/>if once disfavoured by the <hi>Grandees</hi> of that potent Faction. A thing ſo ſtomacked by the Commons, that after ſome evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their heat and paſſion, which broke out into open threats, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew, and ſent up an Ordinance to the Lords, tending to diſpoſſeſſe them of all power and command in their Armies. But fearing this device was too weak to hold, they fall upon another and a likelier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which was to bring the <hi>Lords</hi> to ſit in the <hi>Commons</hi> Houſe; where they were ſure they ſhould be inconſiderable both for power and number. And to effect the ſame with more ſpeed and certainty, they had recourſe to their old Arts, drew down Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> with his <hi>general muſter</hi> of ſubſcriptions, and put a petition in his hands, to be rendred by him to the <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that is, themſelves: wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired among other things, that they would vigorouſly proceed unto the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Delinquents;</hi> and that for the more quick diſpatch of the publick buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the State, the <hi>Lords</hi> would pleaſe to <hi>vote</hi> and <hi>ſit</hi> together with the <hi>Commons.</hi> On ſuch uncertain terms, ſuch a tickliſh <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi> do they now hold their place and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Parliament;</hi> who ſo officiouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65909:31"/>with the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of their <hi>Votes</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> birth-right. And this was it which helped them in that time of need. For by this (though ſtale and common) Stratagem did they prevail ſo far upon ſome weak ſpirits, that the Earls of <hi>Kent, Pembroke, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Bullingbrooke,</hi> the Lords <hi>North, Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark</hi> and <hi>Brews,</hi> (a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> but an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Baron, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally called the Earl of <hi>Elgin</hi>) reſolved to yield unto the current of ſo ſtrong a ſtream: and thought they had made a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyage, if by delivering the Lord <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> to the Peoples fury, they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves in the Peoples favour. And we know well, both who it was, and what end he came to, who though he <hi>knew</hi> that the <hi>accuſed party was delivered him out of envy</hi> only, and that he found no <hi>evil</hi> he was guilty of; yet being wearied with the clamours and the <hi>Crucifiges</hi> of the common people, and fearing that ſome <hi>tumult</hi> would be made about it, <hi>delivered him unto his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to be put to death. And for thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lords</hi> who withdrew themſelves, and neither durſt <hi>condemn</hi> nor <hi>protect the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> (though far the <hi>major</hi> part, as it is reported) it is not eaſie to determin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65909:32"/>their conſciences were more tender, their Colluſion groſſer, or their courage weaker. All I ſhall ſay is only this, that <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> had been as guilty of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s death, as any of the <hi>forty</hi> who had <hi>vowed to kill him;</hi> if upon notice of the Plot which was laid to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, he had <hi>brought him down unto the people,</hi> or not conveied him with a ſtrong guard to the Court of <hi>Felix.</hi> The journies end muſt needs be foul, which ſuch lewd and crooked waies do conduct unto. And it is worth your obſervation, that the ſame day, the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> in which they paſſed this <hi>bloody Ordinance,</hi> (as if therein they would cry quittance with his Sacred Majeſty, who on the ſame accuſed the ſix guilt Members) they paſſed another for eſtabliſhing their new <hi>Directory;</hi> which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was nothing but a total abolition of the Common-Prayer-Book: and thereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the World, how little hopes they had of ſetling their new form of Worſhip, if the foundation of it were not laid in blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bill</hi> being thus diſpatched in the Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> (if ſtill they may be called <hi>Lords,</hi> which are ſo <hi>over-loaded</hi> by the Common-people) there wanted yet the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65909:32"/>Kings <hi>Aſſent</hi> to give life to it: which they ſo far contemned, (they had more reaſon to deſpair of it) that they never ſought it. They had ſcrewed up their <hi>Ordinances</hi> to ſo high a pitch, that never <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was of more authority: and having found the Subjects ſo obedient, as to yield unto them in matters which concerned them in their <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>liberties;</hi> it was but one ſtep more to make trial of them, whether they would ſubmit their lives to the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame tyranny: And this they made the firſt experiment in this kind, both of their own <hi>power,</hi> and the peoples <hi>patience;</hi> he being the <hi>firſt man,</hi> as himſelf noted in his Speech (which words are purpoſely omitted in <hi>Hindes</hi> Copy of it;) <hi>that was</hi> ever put to death by <hi>Ordinance</hi> in Parliament; but was not the laſt, as we have too ſadly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. Certain it is, that by that <hi>Ordinance</hi> they then made themſelves the abſolute Maſter of the Subjects <hi>lives,</hi> and left them nothing that they could call their own, but ruine and deſtruction. Juſt as it was obſerved by our Gracious Soveraign, upon occaſion of the <hi>Ordinance</hi> for the 20th <hi>part,</hi> that <hi>the ſame power which robbed the Subject of the twentieth part of their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65909:33"/>Eſtates, had by that only made a claim and entituled it ſelf to the other</hi> nineteen, <hi>when ſoever it ſhould be thought expedient to haſten on the general ruin.</hi> In which His Majeſty proved but too true a <hi>Prophet.</hi> And though perhaps ſome of the people were well pleaſed with this bloody <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and ran with joy to ſee it put in <hi>execution:</hi> yet all wiſe men did look upon it as the laſt groan or gaſp of our dying <hi>liberty.</hi> And let both them and thoſe who paſſed it, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of this, that they who did ſo gladly <hi>ſell</hi> the blood of their fellow Subjects, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom want <hi>Chapmen</hi> for their own in an open <hi>Market.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, as it was once obſerved, that the predominant Party of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> to bring about their ends in the death of <hi>Barnovelt,</hi> ſubverted all thoſe <hi>fundamental Laws</hi> of the <hi>Belgick liberty;</hi> for maintenance whereof they took up Arms againſt <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, ſo would I know which of thoſe <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government have not been viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe men in their whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for preſervation of which Laws (or rather under colour of ſuch preſervation) they did bewitch the people unto that Rebellion: It is a <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65909:33"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and the firſt Article in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that the Church of <hi>England ſhall be free, and ſhall have her whole Rights and Priviledges inviolable:</hi> yet to make way unto the condemnation of this innocent man, and other the like wicked and ungodly ends, the Biſhops muſt be Voted out of their place in Parliament, which moſt of them had held far longer in their Predeceſſors, than any of our noble families in their Progenitors. And if the <hi>Lords</hi> refuſe to give way unto it (as at firſt they did) the people muſt come down to the Houſe in multitudes, and cry, <hi>No Biſhops, no Biſhops,</hi> at the Parliament doors, till by the terror of their tumults they extort it from them. It is a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberty, that no <hi>Free-man ſhall be taken or impriſoned without cauſe ſhewn,</hi> or <hi>be detained</hi> without being <hi>brought unto his Anſwer in due form of Law:</hi> yet here we ſaw a Freeman impriſoned ten whole weeks together, before any Charge was brought againſt him; and kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon three years more, before his general Accuſation was by them reduced into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and for a year almoſt <hi>detained</hi> cloſe priſoner, without being <hi>brought unto his anſwer,</hi> as the Law requires. It is a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65909:34"/>
               <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>no man be diſſeiſed of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or Liberties,</hi> but by the known <hi>Laws of the Land:</hi> yet here was a man <hi>diſſeiſed</hi> of his Rents and Lands, ſpoyled of his Goods, deprived of his <hi>juriſdiction,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of his Right and Patronage; and all this done, when he was ſo far from being convicted by the Laws of the Land, that no particular charge was ſo much as thought of. It is a <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Liberty, that <hi>no man ſhall be condemned, or put to death, but by lawful judgment of his</hi> Peers, <hi>or by the Law of the Land,</hi> i. e. in the ordinary way of a legal tryal: and ſure an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of both Houſes, without the <hi>Royal Aſsent,</hi> is no part of the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor held an ordinary way of trial for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubject, or ever reckoned to be ſuch in the former times. And finally, it is a <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that <hi>if any other caſe</hi> (than thoſe recited in the Statute of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3.) <hi>which is ſuppoſed to be</hi> Treaſon, <hi>do happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of his Majeſties</hi> Juſtices, <hi>the</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>ſhall tarry without giving judgment, till the cauſe be ſhewn and declared before the</hi> King, <hi>and His</hi> Parliament, <hi>whether it ought to be judged</hi> Treaſon <hi>or not:</hi> yet here we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65909:34"/>had a new found <hi>Treaſon,</hi> never known before, nor declared ſuch by any of His Majeſties <hi>Juſtices,</hi> nor ever brought to be conſidered of by the <hi>King and His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but only <hi>voted</hi> to be ſuch by ſome of thoſe few <hi>Members</hi> which remained at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> who were reſolved to have it ſo for their private ends. Put all which hath been ſaid together, and then tell me truly, if there by any difference (for I ſee not any) between the ancient <hi>Roman ſlaves</hi> and the once <hi>Free-born Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, whoſe <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>liberties,</hi> whoſe <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>fortunes</hi> depend on the meer pleaſure of their <hi>mighty Maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return unto our Story, the paſſing of the <hi>Ordinance</hi> being made known unto him, he neither entertained the news with a <hi>Stoical Apathy,</hi> nor wailed his Fate with weak and womaniſh Lamentations (to which Extreams moſt men are carried in this caſe) but heard it with ſo even and ſo ſmooth a temper, as ſhewed he neither was afraid to live, nor aſhamed to die. The time between the Sentence and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſpent in Prayers and applications to the Lord his God; having obtained, though not without ſome difficulty, a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain of his own, to attend upon him, and to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65909:35"/>aſſiſt him in the work of his preparation: though little preparation needed to receive that Blow, which could not but be welcom, becauſe long expected. For ſo well was he ſtudied in the Art of dying (eſpecially in the laſt and ſtricteſt part of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that by continual Faſting, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prayers, and ſuch like Acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Humiliation, his fleſh was rarified into Spirit, and the whole man ſo fitted for eternal Glories, that he was more then half in heaven, before death brought his bloudy (but triumphant) Chariot to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey him thither. He that had been ſo long a <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> could not but think it a releaſe of miſeries to be made a <hi>Martyr.</hi> And as it is recorded of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, that the night before his beſt and greateſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> he fell into ſo ſound a ſleep, that his Princes hardly could awake him when the Morning came; ſo is is certified of this great <hi>Prelate,</hi> that on the Evening before his <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſmal combat betwixt him and death, after he had refreſhed his ſpirits with a moderate Supper, he betook himſelf unto his reſt, and ſlept very ſoundly, till the time came, in which his Servants were appointed to attend his Riſing, a moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65909:35"/>ſign of a Soul prepared. The fatal morning being come, he firſt applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his private Prayers, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till <hi>Penington,</hi> and other of their publick Officers came to conduct him to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: which he aſcended with ſo brave a courage, ſuch a cheerful countenance, as if he had mounted rather to behold a triumph, then to be made a Sacrifice, and came not there to die, but to be tranſlated. And to ſay Truth, it was no Scaffold, but a Throne, a Throne whereon he ſhortly was to receive a Crown, even the moſt glorious Crown of Martyrdom. And though ſome rude, uncivil people reviled him, as he paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, with opprobrious Language, as loath to let him go to the Grave in peace, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcompoſed his thoughts, nor diſturbed his patience. For he had profited ſo well in the School of Chriſt, <hi>that when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, he reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed his cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> And as he did not fear the Frowns, ſo neither did he cover the applauſe of the vulgar Herd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather choſe to read what he had to ſpeak unto the People, then to affect the Oſtentation either of memory or wit in that dreadful Agony; whether with greater
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65909:36"/>Magnanimity or Prudence, I can hardly ſay. As for the matter of his Speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what did concern himſelf and his own purgation, his great care was to clear His Majeſty, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> from any inclination unto Popery; (with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivaſion of the which, the Authors of our then miſeries, had abuſed the People, and made them take up Arms againſt their Soveraign.) approving himſelf a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant to the laſt. By means whereof, as it is ſaid of <hi>Samſon,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> that <hi>the men which he ſlew at his death, were more then they which he ſlew in his Life:</hi> ſo may it be affirmed of this famous Prelate, that he gave a greater blow unto the enemies of God and the King at the hour of his Death, then he had given them in his whole life before; But this you will more clearly ſee by the Speech it ſelf, which followeth here, according to the beſt and moſt perfect Copies.</p>

               <p>THis is an uncomfortable time to preach, yet I ſhall begin with a Text of Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Let us run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience that Race which is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our Faith, who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been long in my Race, and how I have looked to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of my Faith, he beſt knowes: I am now come to the end of my Race, and here I find the Croſſe, a death of ſhame, but the ſhame muſt be deſpiſed, or no coming to the right hand of God; <hi>Jeſus</hi> deſpiſed the ſhame for me, and God forbid but I ſhould deſpiſe the ſhame for him: I am going apace (as you ſee) towards the Red Sea; and my feet are now upon the very Brink of it; an Argument, I hope, that God is bringing me into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65909:37"/>for that was the way through which he led his People: But before they came to it, he inſtituted a Paſſeover for them, a Lamb it was, but it muſt be eaten with ſour herbs; I ſhall obey, and labour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the ſour herbs, as well as the Lamb. And I ſhall remember it is the Lords Paſſeover; I ſhall not think of the herbs, nor be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the hand which gathereth them; but look up only to him who inſtituted that, and governs theſe; For men can have no more power over me, then what is given them from above. I am not in love with this paſſage through the Red Sea, for I have the weakneſſe and infirmities of fleſh and bloud plentifully in me: and I have prayed with my Saviour, <hi>ut tranſiret Calix iſte,</hi> that this Cup of Red Wine might paſſe from me: But if not, Gods will (not mine) be done, and I ſhall moſt willingly drink of this Cup, as deep, as he pleaſes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this Sea, yea and paſſe through it, in the way that he ſhall lead me.</p>
               <p>But I would have it remembred (good people) that when Gods Servants were in this boyſterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> among them, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> which perſecuted them (and did in a manner drive them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Sea) were drowned in the ſame
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65909:37"/>waters, while they were in purſuit of them: I know my God whom I ſerve, is as able to deliver me from this Sea of Bloud, as he was to deliver the Three Children from the Furnace; and (I moſt humbly thank my Saviour for it) my Reſolution is now, as theirs was then: They would not worſhip the Image the King had ſet up, nor will I the Imaginations which the people are ſetting up; nor will I forſake the Temple and the Truth of God, to follow the bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calf, in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> And as for this People, they are at this day miſerably miſled (God of his mercy open their eyes, that they may ſee the right way) for at this day the Blind lead the Blind, and if they go on, both will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fall into the Ditch. For my ſelf, I am (and I acknowledge it in all humility) a moſt grievous ſinner many waies, by thought, word, and deed, and I cannot doubt, but that God hath Mercy in ſtore for me (a poor Penitent) as well as for other ſinners; I have now upon this ſad occaſion, ranſacked every Corner of my heart, yet (&amp; I thank God) I have not found (among the many) any one ſin which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves death by any known Law of this Kingdom: And yet hereby I charge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65909:38"/>upon my Judges; for if they proceed upon Proof (by valuable Witneſſes) I, or any other Innocent, may be juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And (I thank God) though the weight of the Sentence lie heavy upon me, I am as quiet within, as ever I was in my life. And though I am not only the firſt Archbiſhop, but the firſt man that ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Ordinance of Parliament, yet ſome of my Predeceſſors have gone this way, though not by this means; For <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phegus</hi> was hurried away, and loſt his Head by the <hi>Danes;</hi> and <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> in the Fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and his Fellows: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe, St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had his Head danced off by a Lewd Woman, and St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſubmitted his Head to a perſecuting Sword. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (great and good) and they teach me Patience: For I hope my Cauſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will look of another Dye, then the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that is put upon it here. And ſome comfort it is to me, not only that I go the way of theſe great men in their ſeveral ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, but alſo that my Charge (as foul as 'tis made) looks like that of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (Acts 25.3.) For he was accuſed for the Law and the Temple, <hi>i. e.</hi> Religion: And like that of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65909:38"/>(<hi>Acts</hi> 6.14.) for breaking the Ordinances which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, <hi>i. e.</hi> Law and Religion, the holy place and the Temple (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) But you will ſay, do I then compare my ſelf with the Integrity of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, far be that from me; I only raiſe a Comfort to my ſelf, that theſe great Saints and Servants of God were laid at in their times, as I am now. And 'tis memorable, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who helped on this Accuſation againſt S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> did after fall under the very ſame himſelf. Yea, but here is a great Clamour, that I would have brought in Popery: I ſhall anſwer that more fully by and by: In the mean time, you know what the Phariſees ſaid againſt Chriſt himſelf, <hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe in him,</hi> &amp; venient Romani, <hi>and the Romans will come, and take away both our Place and the Nation.</hi> Here was a cauſeleſſe Cry againſt Chriſt that the <hi>Romans will come:</hi> And ſee how juſt the Judgment of God was; they crucified Chriſt, for fear leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come, and his death was it, which brought in the <hi>Romans</hi> upon them; God puniſhing them with that which they moſt feared: And I pray God this Clamour of <hi>venient Romani,</hi> (of which I have given no cauſe) help not to bring
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65909:39"/>them in; for the Pope never had ſuch a Harveſt in <hi>England</hi> ſince the Reformation, as he hath now upon the Sects and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are amongſt us. In the mean time, <hi>by honour and diſhonour, by good and evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as a Deceiver, and yet true,</hi> am I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8.—Some Particulars alſo I think it not amiſs to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>And firſt, this I ſhall be bold to ſpeak of the King our Gracious Soveraign, He hath been much traduced for bringing in of Popery; but on my Conſcience, (of which I ſhall give God a very preſent account) I know Him to be as free from this Charge, as any man living: and I hold him to be as ſound a Proteſtant (according to the Religion by Law eſtabliſhed) as any man in this Kingdom; and that he will venture his Life as far and as freely for it; and I think I do, or ſhould know, both His af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Religion, and His Grounds for it, as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Particular is concerning this great and Populous City, (which God bleſs.) Here hath been of late, a faſhion taken up, to gather hands, and then to go to the Great Court of this Kingdom (the Parliament) and clamour for Juſtice, as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65909:39"/>if that great and wiſe Court, before whom the Cauſes come, (which are unknown to the many) could not, or would not do Juſtice, but at their appointment. A way, which may endanger many an <hi>Innocent</hi> man, and pluck his bloud upon their own heads, and perhaps upon the Cities alſo: And this hath been lately practiſed againſt my ſelf; <hi>[the Magiſtrate ſtanding ſtill, and ſuffering them openly to proceed from Pariſh to Pariſh without check;]</hi> God forgive the ſetters of this (with all my heart I beg it) but many well meaning People are caught by it. In St. <hi>Stephens</hi> caſe, when nothing elſe would ſerve, <hi>they ſtirred up the people againſt him;</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> went the ſame way, when he had killed St. <hi>James,</hi> yet he would not venter upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> till he found how the other <hi>pleaſed the people.</hi> But take heed of having your <hi>hands full of bloud,</hi> for there is a time (beſt known to himſelf) when God (above other ſins) <hi>makes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for bloud,</hi> and when that Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is on foot, the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That God remembers</hi> (but that's not all) <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and forgets not the Complaint of the Poor,</hi> that is, whoſe bloud is ſhed by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. take heed of this, <hi>'Tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65909:40"/>God,</hi> but then eſpecially, <hi>when he is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inquiſition for bloud;</hi> And (with my Prayers to avert it) I do heartily deſire this City to remember the Propheſie that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.15.</p>
               <p>The third particular is the poor Church of <hi>England.</hi> It hath flouriſhed and been a ſhelter to other neighbouring Churches, when ſtorms have driven upon them. But, alas, now 'tis in a ſtorm it ſelf, and God only knows whether, or how it ſhall get out: and (which is worſe than a ſtorm from without) its become like an Oak cleft to ſhivers with wedges made out of its own body, and at every cleft prophaneneſſe and irreligion is entring in, while as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper</hi> ſpeaks (in his ſecond Book <hi>De vit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu, cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>Men that introduce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe are cloaked over with the name</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis Imaginariae, <hi>of Imaginary Religion:</hi> for we have loſt the Subſtance, and dwell too much in Opinion, and that Church which all the Jeſuits machinations could not ruine, is fallen into danger by her own.</p>
               <p>The laſt particular (for I am not willing to be too long) is my ſelf: I was born and baptized in the boſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law; in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

            <p>When the Long Parliament firſt ſate, theſe two Gentlemen, with the reſt of the Kingdom, rejoyced to ſee that day, and ſtood at gaze, as greedily as any, expecting what acts of Bounty, what Relief of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the King would through their hands convey unto his Subjects. And while they kept in the Sphere of their Duty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, were as forward to applaud them as any, but after the Publication of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,</hi> wherein the Parliament ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably ſlandered the Kings Government, which was the Ground-work of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and the Critical time being come, in which men muſt either declare themſelves, either for, or againſt their Soveraign, though the City was deeply leavened with diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Principles, yet theſe Gentlemen, and the major Part of the Citizens, of whom they were chief, were the Kings moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects. They were men of good eſteem, plentiful eſtates, known Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and true Children of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who ſeeing the miſerable condition of thoſe places where the Rebels bore ſway, and beginning to be ſenſible of the ſame Bondage under Col. <hi>Eſsex,</hi> entred into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65909:46"/>how to put the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> into the Kings Poſſeſſion and Protection. To this purpoſe, they diſpatcht an Agent to the Court, to inform the King, that he had many good Subjects in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and withal, to ſignifie their deſire to deliver up his own City to himſelf, if he would ſend ſome of his Forces thither, to take it: The Inducements and Reaſons of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, were theſe;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſcience to God, not to reſiſt the King, <hi>knowing they that do, ſhall receive unto themſelves Damnation.</hi> Deteſting that abominable Sect of the <hi>Hothamites,</hi> thoſe State-Hereticks, who accounted it their duty to keep the Kings Towns for the Kings uſe, by ſhutting the Gates againſt the Kings Perſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the frequent Affronts given to His Majeſty by ſcandalous and diſloyal Speeches on all Occaſions belched out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, by Proteſtations, Declarations, Meſſages, Contempt of his Gracious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, before the Face of his Meſſengers, as to inſtance in Sr. <hi>Baynham Throckmorton,</hi> whom the King ſent to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> requiring the Mayor and Aldermen, not to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to any of the Parliament Forces, promiſing, that he himſelf would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65909:46"/>any on them, together with tender of the promiſe of his Favour; yet did the Mayor and Sheriffe, two Boutefews in that City, ſend 4 Pieces of Ordnance at that very inſtant to <hi>Marleborough,</hi> to be employed againſt the King.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Out of regard to their own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to quit themſelves of (thoſe Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Grievances under which they ſuffered, and theſe were many; 1. The often repeated Taxations and Loans of Money unto the King and Parliament, as they were pleaſed to twiſt them upon the thredbare Security of the publick Faith, the illegal exactions employed for repairing the Caſtle, building of Forts, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Garriſon againſt the King. 2. By urging upon them new and treaſonable Votes and Proteſtations, if not fully in words, yet in the uſe and interpretation of them, directly oppoſite to the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, the Oath of every Citizen, when made a Freeman, with a paticular Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to reſiſt Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Brainford,</hi> the Lord Marqueſſe <hi>Hertford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> Sr. <hi>Ralph-Hopton,</hi> and their Forces. 3. By their diſarming all ſuch as were any way ſuſpected to bear duty and Affection
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65909:47"/>to his Majeſty, unleſſe they would take the aforeſaid Proteſtations. 4. The perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Scorn and Obloquy to which they were expoſed, being reproached every day, as they paſſed the ſtreets, with the names of Malignants and Papiſts. 5. The General Contempt and Prophanation of Gods holy Worſhip and Service, tearing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, Becauſe upon the Point, they were confined to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> not daring to go out of the City; for in all places where the Commands and Ordinances of the Two Houſes prevailed, they had given a Liſt of the Names of thoſe that durſt appear for the King, to the end, that if any of them came thither, they might be apprehended, and ſent Priſoners to <hi>Taunton, Barkley</hi> Caſtle, as Deliſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>quents to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>It was no wonder therefore, that a City thus robbed of its Wealth and Liberty, groaning under an inſupportable Yoke of Bondage and Tyranny, ſhould endeavour, by reſtoring the King to his Rights, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore themſelves to their former Freedom. Upon theſe Motives therefore they enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a Loyal Confederacy, to deliver the City from its Captivity, into his Majeſties Protection, if poſſible, without any blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65909:47"/>as afterwards by their Examination appeared.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore true, that theſe two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with their Aſſociates, had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to caſt out the Rebels, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Briſtol</hi> for the King, and ro ſeize the Governour, and ſome of the Chief Rebels, but not to kill them; and to that end, a Commiſſion was got, and ſent to Mr. <hi>Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> to raiſe Forces, and conſtitute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders for the Kings Service; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Proteſtation was drawn by Mr. <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> to be taken by all the Partakers in this buſineſſe, which fully expreſt their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this undertaking; which being in general Terms, for the Aſſiſtance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the King, againſt all Forces raiſed without his Command, need not here be inſerted.</p>
            <p>After Communication of Counſels, and many Meſſages interchanged between <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> drawing to the Deſign, ſome of the Parliament Officers under Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with a Party of the Kings Forces, ſhould face the City on <hi>Durdan</hi>-Down, diſtant not a full Mile from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65909:48"/>while they within, ſhould poſſeſſe and make good <hi>Froom Gate</hi> and <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſeize the Court of Guards, open the Gates, and give the Signal thereof, for the Kings For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make their Approach, by Ringing of St. <hi>Johns</hi> and St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Bels. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> came, expecting the Signal by Five of the Clock in the morning, and the Ports to be opened, but the Combination was diſcovered, and theſe two Gentlemen, with others, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there being found ſeveral Armed men with them in their Houſes, which being ſignified to the Prince, he marched pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently away.</p>
            <p>Having them thus in their power, they clap Irons upon them, tie them Head and Feet together, make them cloſe Priſoners, deprive them of all Comfort to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by their Wives, Children, or Friends, and uſed them with that Barbarouſneſs and Inhumanity as is not imaginable could be practiſed by one Chriſtian upon another; and after 11 weeks hard Impriſonment, frequent Examination, barbarous inſulting over them, eſpecially by <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi> they were brought to their Trial at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, where, upon the Articles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt them, by Advocate <hi>Walker,</hi>

            <p>This Letter arrived at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the very day of the Execution of theſe Gentlemen: but <hi>Fiennes</hi> either imagining or knowing of ſuch a thing, kept the Gates ſhut all the day, ſo that none could come in or out, and when the Murder was perpetrated, and the Meſſenger admitted, contrary to the Law
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65909:51"/>of Arms and Nations, he was ſent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where he continued a long time.</p>
            <p>What could a Gracious Prince do more? but having not Power to compel, what he could not perſwade, they perſiſted in their bloudy Purpoſes. For after Sentence of Death paſſed on them, they purſued them with Threats, and uſed no other Language to them, but death and Hanging, often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing what they could but once inflict: So that every hour they expected death. Having thus languiſhed ſome dayes under theſe bloudy Inſultations, being frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their neceſſary Comforts, by the Guards that ſtood at the Priſon doors, for no other purpoſe. If Execution had not been haſtned, Famine would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their publick deſpight. For Mr. <hi>Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> whom of the Two, they moſt hated, being loaden with Irons, and ſtifled with the Naſtineſs of the Dungeon, waſted, and conſumed through want of Food, but <hi>filled with the ſcornful Reproofs of the Proud,</hi> by reproaches, and ſuch like rancorous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, was ready to die that Morning of his Execution: For being a man of a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Spirit, a large Soul, and of great employments, was more ſenſible of Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, ſo that fitting by his Wife that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65909:52"/>Morning, and leaning on her Breaſt, he fell into a ſwoon, and probably had then departed, but that the ſhrieks and outcries of his Wife recalled him to a more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Death, that ſo Poſterity might read his Name with Mr. <hi>Bowchers,</hi> not in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Confeſſors, but enrolled in the Noble Army of Martyrs.</p>
            <p>The time of their Execution was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, for fear the City ſhould oppoſe ſo bloody a Fact; but when the Fatal day was come, <hi>Fiennes</hi> drew his Forces into the Mariſh, the common place where they make their Muſters, and then ſuddenly cauſed the Gates to be ſhut, &amp; drew Horſe and Foot into every ſtreet of the City, to awe the Citizens, and to ſuppreſs Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which the Indignity and affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to two of their moſt eminent Fellow-Citizens, whoſe Crime was nothing elſe but Loyalty, might incite them to; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they ſhould conſider, that an Iſſue of Bloud was that day opened, that might in the end prove fatal to them, and involve them in the ſame condition, if they ſhould ſee thoſe Perſons led to the ſlaughter, and they ſtand like Sheep, and not oppoſe it; for if <hi>Fiennes</hi> and his Blood-hounds ſhould for any other Vertue, as well as Loyalty
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65909:52"/>paſs the ſame Sentence on any of them, who ſhould defend them, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Kings Protection, are grown ſo tame, as not to venture their Lives for themſelves.</p>
            <p>All things being thus made ſecure, the Priſoners are brought from the Caſtle, to the Main Court of Guard, being ſaluted all the way thither, by the people, who preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with hazard enough to ſee and take leave of theſe Martyrs, who would have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their Liberty; they likewiſe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearty thanks for their dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their Affections, it being a ſin next to Malignancy, to own them, or pray for them.</p>
            <p>To fit themſelves for their ends, they deſired they might have the aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Toogood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Standfaſt,</hi> two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and pious Miniſters of that City, to ſweeten the Cup they were ready to drink, but this Chriſtian Requeſt was moſt unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly denied them, and two Miniſters of the Faction deſigned for their miſerable Comforters.</p>
            <p>When they were at the foot of the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that Tree which was preſently to bear fruit to Eternal Life, it was obſerved by ſome of the Murderers, that knew the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65909:53"/>knack of it, that the Halters were either too long or ſhort, or ſome fault, which made the Executioner go and take them off, whereupon the People that were Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of this bloudy Tragedy, that ſtood at a diſtance, and knew not the reaſon of their ſo doing, conceiving, that <hi>Fiennes</hi> had ſent a Reprieve, ſuddenly expreſſed their Joy, by loud Acclamations; but the deaths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man making his Fatal Inſtruments faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the Guards continuing ſtill upon the place; as if they were thunder-ſtruck, they ſtood ſtill aſtoniſhed, and ſoon chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Joy into Tears and Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Being thus ready to be offered up as a Sacrifice to the implacable rage and malice of <hi>Fiennes</hi> and his fellow-Rebels; Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Yeomans</hi> firſt aſcended the Ladder, thence to reach his Crown of Martyrdom; but before he went up, he took care, after the example of our Saviour, to recommend his wife to his father in Law, Mr. <hi>Yeomans,</hi> in this addreſſe, that he had left him a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, his VVife then great with child, and eight ſmall children, the Eldeſt not able to put on his own Cloaths, and ſo after many Embraces, left him, and ſet forward on his way to Heaven.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:65909:53"/>
            <p> Being thus ſeated in that place of ſhame and diſgrace (as it is in its own nature, where the Cauſe doth not change the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Tree into a Theatre of Honour) and ſeeing himſelf made a Spectacle to that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein he had lived in plenty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, being Sheriffe but the Year before, which Office he diſcharged with as much Magnificence and Bounty as any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. And from that Proſpect, taking a view of many friends that could not well look through their Tears to ſee him again; ſeeing alſo others (of a far different temper, that rejoyced in his ſufferings, amongſt which, was <hi>Robert Baugh,</hi> one of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Council of VVar, in a moſt deviliſh cruelty) ſtand jeering and mocking at him to his face, here fleſh and bloud interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which tranſported him to an Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, bordering between Indignation and Submiſſion, ſaying, <hi>Good God, what have I done to be here?</hi> but inſtantly ſorry that humane Frailty ſhould extort any thing from him unbeſeeming the Juſtice of his Cauſe, or the hardneſs of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſilencing the Suggeſtions, of ſuch evil Counſellors, he compoſed himſelf to ſpeak to the People.</p>
            <p>Being weakned by long and many Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65909:54"/>he was not able to ſpeak much, or loud, only as to clear himſelf from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of an intent to have maſſacred all that adhered to the Parliament: Laying his Hand upon his Breaſt, and fixing his eyes on Heaven, the Habitation of the God of Truth, he made a ſolemn Proteſtation of his Innocency from any ſuch thought, and withal, profeſſed a firm perſwaſion of the Juſtice of that cauſe for which he ſuffered; adding, <hi>that if he had more Lives, he would ſacrifice them all to his Soveraign in that way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was thus ſpeaking, Major <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Langriſh</hi> (ſince dead in Goal, and extream want, having before betrayed his Maſter, the King, in diſcovering his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Coming to the Houſe of Commons, to demand the 5 Members, who by that means had time to ſhift away) and <hi>Clifton</hi> call upon the Executioner to haſten his work, they interrupted Mr. <hi>Yeomans</hi> alſo, and goaded him in the thighs with their Halberts, bidding him to make an end; for they were yet afraid of his reſcue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he deſired the Witneſſes of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to ſing with him the 130 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which he ſung with great Devotion and Fervency; knowing that he ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65909:54"/>tranſlated out of <hi>Bochim,</hi> the valley of Tears, into that triumphant Quire, where with Angels he ſhould ſing Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah for evermore. Having finiſhed the Pſalm, and his Prayers, and deſired God not to charge his Bloud on that City, and having prayed for his Perſecuters, charging his friends not to harbour any revengeful Thoughts againſt them, and in the cloſe of all, beginning to defend his cauſe, as words which would leave the deepeſt impreſſion, this <hi>Langriſh</hi> and <hi>Clifton</hi> cauſed him to be thrown off the Ladder, hardly affording him time to recommend his ſoul unto God. Being thrown off, and his Brother M. <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi> ſtaying his Body that ſwung with the fall, this <hi>Clifton</hi> gave the ſaid Mr. <hi>Haggat</hi> ſuch a Blow with his Cane, that almoſt ſtruck him to the ground. Oh the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inhumanity of theſe Villains!</p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Yeomans</hi> was thus executed, without any reſiſtance of the Citizens, there being no danger of Oppoſition, they wade on in Bloud, commanding Mr. <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> to aſcend the Ladder. He had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what he had intended to ſpeak, being very large, exhorting thoſe who had ſet their hands to this Plow, meaning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kings cauſe, not to be too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65909:55"/>(as terrified with their Sufferings) to take them off, and words to ſuch purpoſe, deſcribing the Schiſmaticks, according to the Character of them, drawn by the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil of the Holy Ghoſt, in Scripture phraſe, in which he was excellently well read, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confeſt by his very enemies, to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Religious man; inſtancing in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable place of S. <hi>Jude, Proud, Boaſters, Heady, Unſtable,</hi> &amp;c. But it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to ſpeak all out, by thoſe men who knew themſelves ſo much concerned; at laſt preſſed on to the acceleration of his end by thoſe who were ſwift to ſhed bloud, he deſired to ſing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. which being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he began to recommend himſelf to God by pathetical Prayers and Ejaculations, wherein he was interrupted, by a Factious Levite, one <hi>Roſewel,</hi> who called him Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and Apoſtate, reviling him, that after ſo ſtrict a converſation and ſo much time ſpent in the Profeſſion of Religion, he ſhould render all ſuſpected for hypocriſie, by ſo obſtinate perſeverance in Rebellion againſt the Parliament. This ſhook not the conſtancy of this Reſolved Martyr, who held up with St. <hi>Bernard, Scutum Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae contra Gladium Linguae,</hi> the Buckler of a good Conſcience againſt the Blowes of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65909:55"/>a malicious Tongue, and ſo ſuſtaining himſelf with that comfortable Promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>Bleſſed are you when men ſhall revile you,</hi> &amp;c. he yielded himſelf to the will and deſire of his Murderers. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Prieſt in his very fall from the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, purſuing him with the ſame odious Names of Hypocrite and Apoſtate, thereby, if poſſible, to diſturb the Peace of his Soul, in the moment of his Death; a deviliſh Practiſe in extending Malice even to the Endeavours of a ſecond Death.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Glorious Martyrs now lying under the Altar, having thus through their Ignominious deaths, in a Glorious cauſe, and with a pure Conſcience rendred their Souls to God, the ſad Spectators ſmite their Breſts, and return. Never was there ſo general a Face of ſorrow, ſuch bitter lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations heard in that City, as on that day. Their Bodies taken down, were both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Mr. <hi>Yeomans</hi> his Houſe, Father in Law to the Martyr. In the Evening, M. <hi>Bowchers</hi> Body was conveyed to his own Houſe, a ſad Spectacle to his poor Widow, and ſeven Orphans, and at night both were interred, Mr. <hi>Yeomans</hi> at <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bowchers</hi> at St. <hi>Warburghs,</hi> their Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals being attended by thoſe Orthodox Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

            <p>This moſt horrid Fact, no Hiſtory, no not that of the Anabaptiſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> comes near, ſo that, it is miſerably and cruelly beholding to a Parallel in the ſame Kingdom, the deplorable Butchery of Mr. <hi>Tompkins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Challoner</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which ſoon after followed; as it doth here, in order of time.</p>

            <p>THe rebellious faction having ſacrificed thoſe Gentlemen to the <hi>Moloch</hi> of their diſloyal cruelty, under the vizor of a bleſſed Reformation in one of the chiefeſt Cities in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> thereby to ſtrike terror in the minds of all men, who ſhould dare to be honeſt, and be according to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty faithful to their Soveraign, to which in ſpight of all their ſpecious pretences, they ſaw the wiſeſt and ſobreſt part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very much inclined, and to give more flagitious authority to their illegal and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage proceedings, by perpetrating the ſame violences in the Metropolis of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, before the faces of al the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Courts of Judicature, thereby to amuſe the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and unintelligent ſort of people, upon whom their main deſign was bottomed, as if they had the Law clearly on their ſide in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65909:57"/>that horrid rebellion, proceeded further in the ſame manner againſt theſe two Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, the cauſe of whoſe Deaths, take as followeth, being upon the ſame account with their preceding fellow ſufferers.</p>
            <p>After that the Faction had waded ſo far in their diſloyalty againſt the King, as to levy a War againſt him, had ſeized moſt of his Magazines, Cities, and places of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, had poſſeſt themſelves of all his Ships, and therewith infeſted thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ſtood for him, had defied and bid him battle, wherein his Sacred Perſon was alike endangered with the meaneſt of his Rebels, in which it pleaſed God, ſo to aſſiſt the King, that thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> found themſelves deceived in the Kings ſtrength; he ſuddenly after <hi>Edg-hill</hi> fight marching up to <hi>Branford</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> and putting the Members and the tumultuous Cititzens into a deſerved conſternation and confuſion; and yet amidſt all theſe terrors of War, had offered them terms of Peace, laying aſide the great advantages his Majeſty might promiſe himſelf from the ſtate of affairs, in which his ſucceſſes had placed him, yet notwithſtanding all his repeated propoſals for an accommodation, nothing could be effected, with thoſe men
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65909:57"/>whoſe ears were deaf to the charms of Peace, though never ſo prudent and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as being widely diſtant from thoſe ends and deſigns, which they had laid in the War, being the ſpoil of three Kingdoms. When I ſay, theſe Gentlemen perceived into what a miſerable condition the whole Nation (reflecting tenderly alſo upon blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Ireland</hi>) was like ſpeedily to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the diſſembled covetouſneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious obſtinacy, implacable malice and deviliſh cunning and ſubtilty of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular cheats upon the multitude; then did ſeveral worthy Citizens endeavour to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and obviate thoſe growing miſchiefs, which they did foreſee would inevitably fall upon this Church and State.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore, they addreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by way of Petition, earneſtly ſueing to the two Houſes, that they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to hear their Soveraign, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude or prejudice, the way to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a reſolute fixedneſſe in thoſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which they humbly ſhewed, could not but be dreadful and deſtructive to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. A Petition to this effect, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand hands and hearts was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly tendred, whereunto they received a ſlight anſwer, that the Houſes would do
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65909:58"/>what in their wiſdom they thought fit, and that the Petitioners were, as their duty was, to acquieſſe and reſt in their Counſels and determinations, which ſhould provide without their direction, for the ſafety of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>From this Anſwer to this purport and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they ſoon wel perceived, what the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thoſe men was, and that their firſt whimſie, that dark cloud of jealouſies and fears, was big with a tempeſtuous ſtorm, impending over the lives and eſtates of the King and his good Subjects. They ſaw a ſeditious and pragmatical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon continued Lord Mayor,
<note place="margin">1. Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for two years together, who by his Warrants and Officers did plunder, vex and impriſon all men but ſuſpected of duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King, ſo that none of them could promiſe themſelves ſecurity for a night. They ſaw ſeveral meſſengers ſent to the City by the King moſt ſhamefully abuſed, impriſoned and threatened with Death, which was afterwards rigorouſly executed. No man, at their Common Halls and Councils, durſt aſſume the due freedom and liberty of ſpeech, to declare his mind concerning the grievances and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65909:58"/>troubles of the time, in order to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of them by an amicable compoſure, but ſtraight he was apprehended, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſome Goal or other, whereof their cruelty had ſo much occaſion, that many noble Houſes, the honour and beauty of the City (a ſhame and grief to ſee) were converted thereinto. Nor fared it better with the Houſes of God, which were ſtript and deſpoiled of all their Ornaments, and the impertinencies of mad zealotry, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and railing invectives againſt the Government eſtabliſhed in their room. They ſaw that goodly and beautiful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, which was the Honour of the City, <hi>Cheapſide Croſs</hi> demoliſhed, nor could it be told, how far this rage and violence might proceed, to the overturning and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all things ſacred and civil. But that which moſt feelingly affected them, was the periſhing and ruine of Gods living Temples; many, nay moſt of his faithful Miniſters of the Orthodox Clergy, being driven out of their Livings, and reduced to a morſel of bread. Many other the like compaſſionate matters there were, which kindled in the minds of theſe Gentlemen, but becauſe they fall in; and agree with what we have related in the Martyrdome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65909:59"/>of thoſe two Citizens at <hi>Briſtol</hi> I ſhall here omit them.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Motives an Aſſociation was entred into, by a great many worthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſince reaſon could not work upon the ſtubborn minds of the Faction, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them by other means, that was by putting the City into the Kings hands. To this deſign ſome Parliament Members were privy, but none perſonally ingaged, but Mr. <hi>Edmund Waller</hi> (who hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with life, was put out of the Houſe, and fined ten thouſand pound) who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the manage of it, as to their parts, and alſo to make ſome of the Lords aſſiſtant and favourable to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore having digeſted the order and method of their proceedings, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a Commiſſion from the King, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſeveral Citizens and perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and amongſt them to theſe two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whereby power and authority was given them, to levy, liſt, arm, and train, what number of men they ſhould find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and convenient for the Service; and to appoint whom they ſhould confide in for Officers and Commanders. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was conveyed to <hi>London</hi> (as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65909:59"/>went) by the right Honourable the Lady <hi>Aubigney</hi> deceaſed, Mother to his Grace, <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Lenox,</hi> and by her delivered to ſome of the perſons aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Upon receipt thereof, ſeveral meetings and conferences were held, in order to the promoting the ſaid Commiſſion, which was chiefly proſecuted by theſe two Loyal Perſons, who made ſuch progreſs therein, that they had brought the buſineſs into ſome form; when through the zealous haſting of the work (to the countenancing whereof the power &amp; authority of ſome of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament Lords then ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was needful and to be expected) which could not be without ſome buſtle by the Spies and Emiſſaries of the Parliament, and through the inconſtancy and treachery, or unhappy diſcourſe of ſome other engaged perſons, the whole affair came to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and thereupon ſeveral Citizens, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> with theſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were apprehended, and committed Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> to the Tower, the other to Newgate, whence after ſeveral times exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to find out the deſign, and all the parties concerned in it, by confeſſion and confrontation, they were a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65909:60"/>brought to their Tryal before a Court Martial (<hi>London</hi> being then a Garriſon) at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and there ſentenced to be hanged, which was performed the fifth of <hi>July</hi> 1643.</p>
            <p>To ſhew and point at the hainouſneſs of this crime of Loyalty, they were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be executed near their own doors, as more ſhameful and dreadful to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to be hung in the eyes and before the face of their Neighbours, but their Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie miſt its aim, for they were not a whit daunted, neither at the manner or place of Execution, the worſt befel the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inhabitants thereabouts, who had theſe two Gentlemen in very great eſteem, and who were deluged in tears at ſo miſerable a Spectacle. Mr. <hi>Tompkins</hi> finiſhed his Martyrdom in <hi>Holborn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Challoner</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Old <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhil;</hi> They both maintained their Cauſe to their laſt Breath, juſtifying their intentions, in the buſineſſe they ſuffered, for to be lawful and honeſt, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Tompkins,</hi> who ſaid little, but very reſolutely; beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to proſper the King, and bleſs him in his Armies and Councils, deſiring the Spectators not to be offended or deterred from their obedience to him by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65909:60"/>which he ſaid, he looked upon as the greateſt glory in the World; and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his Soul to God, he finiſhed his race, and is now certainly in everlaſting bliſs. Mr. <hi>Challoner</hi> at his Execution ſpake little (being not ſuffered to have any of the ſober pious Clergy with him; but haunted by that ſtage Divine <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>) who after he had prayed with him, Mr. <hi>Challoner</hi> ſpake as followeth.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65909:63"/>ſeveral Oaths of Fealty, by the benefit of their protection and advantages they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under the Government of ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Prince, were to be diſpenſed, nay muſt be diſcharged from that Duty and Obedience they ought him, and that the Parliament as they had ſubdued their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, might give Law to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound their own inſolent terms and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and rigidly inſiſt on them, ſecure his Perſon under pretence of publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, adminiſter the Kingdom themſelves, ſequeſter and ſeize their Eſtates who reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them; in theſe violent and unheard of outrages; all this I ſay, might be (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it could not be helpt, as the ſad ſtate of the miſeries of the Kingdom then was) with ſome kind of patience endured; but to ſee and hear, to be upon the place, where ſo many undutiful unchriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, after the <hi>Votes of Non Addreſſe,</hi> were put upon the King, in that place which he had choſen for his refuge and Sanctuary. I can hardly allow any man in this caſe the glory of Martyrdom, whoſe frame and temper had but the leaſt ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of natural (not to pride it in loyal) compaſſion, if he durſt do that, which bravery and courage prompted him to, the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65909:63"/>Law and his obedience required, and God commanded.</p>
            <p>Yet I do not the leſs wonder, and ſtand amazed at this butchery, upon ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which though they be of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpects, yet do center univerſally in this, that they will make the murder of this perſon prodigiouſly infamous to all perſons concerned in it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, not to meddle with the Laws, whoſe Divine ſtamp was moſt treaſonably defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this act, we will conſider this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Captain <hi>Burleighs,</hi> in the invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able latitude of common humanity.</p>
            <p>His pretended crime was the beating of a <hi>Drum</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> (upon the news the Iſlanders had received, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had rejected the King upon their Votes of <hi>Non addreſſe,</hi> and had reſolved to ſettle the Kingdom without him) when his Majeſty was confined a cloſe Priſoner to <hi>Carisbrook Caſtle.</hi> This was miſconſtrued according to the left-handed learning of thoſe times for Treaſon, whereas had there been any ſympathetical Muſick in thoſe Drums, they would have made a noyſe and Alarm of themſelves, borrowed from thoſe groans and ſighs the captive Prince made to his more compaſſionate walls, who
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65909:64"/>burſt to give vent and eccho to thoſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful notes.</p>
            <p>And could men not allow that ſoft and tender-heartedneſs to men, to Chriſtians, to Subjects, to a Subject too well reputed and eſteemed of in his Iſland as a good and honeſt man, one who out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and integrity, and for no other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter end whatſoever, had faithfully ſerved his Soveraign abroad, that is, had croſt the Sea to do his devoir, and there having we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, he finds death in the place of it; firſt he is chiefly concern'd in the publick ſorrow and diſtreſs of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, thoſe breaths of grief ſoon pierce his ears, and thoſe Royal lamentations heightned by a generous Spirit, quickly tranſport and poſſeſs him, and by this moſt laudable and glorious action, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only a courage to reſcue what villany had captivated, and hindred their wicked attempts no farther, then by affording a brave and imitable example of Loyal mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity to all true Subjects, in all exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and dangers of their Princes, be becomes a ſacrifice to their <hi>Moloch</hi> of Anarchycal Tyranny.</p>

            <p> We will view him in the next conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as his caſe ſtood in direct oppoſition to that of Major <hi>Rolfe,</hi> then an Officer in the Army, and of very great truſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was tryed at the ſame time and Aſſizes, by the ſame Commiſſion, Judges and Jury; and then certainly nothing can appear more flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hainouſly arbitrary than this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans condemnation. <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſit a magis eluceſcunt,</hi> contraries oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one to another, make each of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the clearer, and ſo will it prove in the memory of this Noble Perſon, which will hereby appear in a moſt venerable ſplendor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rolfes</hi> Crime was this, he was accuſed by one Mr. <hi>Osborne</hi> and another gentleman then attending on the King in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where this <hi>Rolfe</hi> had a Charge, to have conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ired the death of the King, and that particularly, by aſſaſſinating him with a Brace of Piſtols; the time and place of this Regicide alſo proved. This Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was firſt made to the Houſe of Lords, and avowed by the ſaid two Gentlemen; whereupon, <hi>Rolfe</hi> being apprehended in <hi>Biſhopsgate</hi> (where he had like to have been torn in pieces by the multitude of people,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65909:65"/>had it not been for their very ſtrong Guards they ſent for him) was carried in a Sedan, to the Gate-houſe, whence he was ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Aſſizes, to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where, at his Arraignment, the whole matter was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually proved againſt him, yet for all that, both by Judges and Jury, the then Lord Chief Baron, and ſome packt deſperate Wretches of that County, he was, to the wonder and aſtoniſhment of all the world, acquitted and freed, and ſoon after ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>Next followed the Inditement and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of this our Martyr, which was layd for levying war againſt the King, to which, he duly and of Right and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, pleaded <hi>Not guilty.</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e matter of Fact which was proved againſt him, was, that he had beaten up Drums in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to raiſe men for to aſſiſt the King againſt the Parliament; ſuch a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it ſelf, that had but Reaſon and Loyalty been at market, there had been no ſuch deſperate Chapmen in the Country; for without more ado, theſe wretched Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows bring him in guilty of High Treaſon, and the Judge gave Sentence accordingly; which was preſently after executed.</p>
            <p>We will conſider Thirdly, that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65909:65"/>of Trial was never offered before, to the Subjects of this Kingdom; thoſe men they murdered upon the Score of Loyalty during the war, were either taken away by their Illegal Ordinances, or Courts Marſhal, and Councils of war, they not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their caſe to the deciſion of the Law, but here aſſoon as they had reduced the King, they thought it an eaſie work to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Laws, and though his Majeſty would not comply with their unlimited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they would bend the Law to their Luſts, and moſt abſolute will and Tyranny, ſo that he is the firſt, who ſuffered as a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freedom.</p>
            <p>Interceſſions were made on all hands for his Life, his poor wife even drowned in tears, imploring their mercy, but there was no Relenting or Compaſſion to be found among thoſe men. So <hi>Feb.</hi> 10. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the day of his bleſſed Exchange, he full of Chriſtian Reſolution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, with Earneſt Prayers to God, for the King and Kingdoms Reſtoration to their former and laſting Happineſs, willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Spirit to God; ſealing his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe, with his laſt Breath and Bloud.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THeſe <hi>Gemini</hi> of Valour and Honour, as well as exact Loyalty, I could not well divide in this Martyrology, being ſo joyned in their deaths, honourable Burial, and Funerals, and being both of them ſo equally eminent in their Generation, for all true worth and Vertue.</p>
            <p>Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> was deſcended of a very Ancient and Illuſtrious Family; he who knows not the Name of <hi>Lucas,</hi> knows nothing of Gentility; but if this Noble Perſon had derived no Honour from his Anceſtors, yet his own purchaſed Glory, and the Relative Merits of his two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Brethren, the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Gervas,</hi> formerly Governour of <hi>Belvoyr</hi> Caſtle (in which three, Nature and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had ſumm'd up a Perfection) will
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65909:66"/>without any other Additaments, tranſmit him to Poſterity as a worthy and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Heroe.</p>
            <p>He was a Perſon aſſiſted with a reſolute Spirit, of an active diſpoſition, and a ſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcretion to manage it; ſtrict and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in his Commands, without any pride or ſurlineſs, free in his Rewards to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Deſert and Quality; in his Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with his Friends, he was affable, and pleaſant; in his Charge ſerious and vigilant; remiſs in nothing that might any way improve or expedite his Diſpatch in the Affairs of VVar, as he is well character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a good Pen.</p>
            <p>We will therefore view him only in the Camp, in which he gloriouſly lived and died, excuſing his Learning and other rare Endowments from the imputation of Crime, and lay all the Load of his miſerable Fate, aggravated by the Name of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Kingdom, upon his Loyal car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and magnanimity, abſtracted from all other Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Tumults and Preparations for War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt their Native &amp; pious Pr. he raiſed a Troop of Horſe in <hi>London,</hi> and like an Expert and Reſolute Commander, behaved himſelf in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65909:67"/>that uncertain Service, being a profeſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Inſolencies and Rebellious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of that Nation.</p>
            <p>That Broyl ceaſing, through the great condeſcentions of the King, to the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Demands of that Kingdom, which kindled the Combuſtions in this, the King being neceſſitated to take up Arms, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Perſon, and the Authority of the Laws againſt the like Rebellion at home, Sr. <hi>Charles</hi> readily engaged on his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns ſide againſt the pretended 2 Houſes. The firſt place where he ſignally ſhewed his Valour in that juſt Cauſe (omitting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts of leſs concernment, as not to our purpoſe) was at <hi>Auburn</hi> Chaſe, and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi> Field, where the firſt memorable Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was fought; here Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> with many other Gallant Gentlemen, behaved themſelves with undanted courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which ſo far engaged him in that dangerous Buſineſs, the fight being obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately maintained, that he received ſome deſperate wounds that fatal day; but the Blood he loſt there, was but an Earneſt or prognoſtick ſtillations &amp; drops of that maſs of Bloud which was afterwards to flow out with his Life, for the ſame Cauſe.</p>
            <p>His next Appearance to the terror of his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65909:67"/>Enemies, his Valour having gained him a frighting name amongſt them, was in his deſerting of <hi>Cawood</hi> Caſtle, aſſaulted by the Parliaments Forces, whence with good conduct, and as true Courage, he forced his way through their Quarters, to ſuch places as he thought convenient, and came at laſt in ſafety to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Bravery in charging at <hi>Marſton Moor,</hi> and enduring the Brunt of his Enemies, when the Fortune of that day declined on the Kings ſide, as it then challenged the Praiſe of all men, ſo it deſerves everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
            <p>His diſcreet and military Management of the Affairs at <hi>Newark,</hi> where he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf an abſolute Souldier, both in Diſcipline of war, and perſonal Action, to the great ſatisfaction of the Governour and Garriſon, which alwaies conſiſted of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and truly Noble Perſons, merits a Record to ſerve as an Example to Future Times.</p>
            <p>His brave and ſucceſſeful Attempt in his March from <hi>Berkly</hi> Caſtle, with part of his Regiment, betwixt <hi>Slymbridge</hi> and <hi>Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> Caſtle, upon Col. <hi>Maſſeys</hi> Garriſons, together with his incomparable Gallantry in the purſuit of his Deſign at <hi>Tedbury,</hi> was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65909:68"/>work for noble Imitation.</p>
            <p>But all theſe Particulars ſignifie nothing to his Heroick Magnanimity in defence of the Town of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> beleaguered by a potent and victorious Army; This was as the Corollary, the ſumming up of all his Atchievements in the times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallations of which place, we ſhall confine and circumſcribe all his Glories.</p>
            <p>After that the Parliament, by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their unlawful Arms had reduced the King, his Friends, Armies, Towns, and Forts into their power, it was hoped by all men, that now they would appear, what they had ſo long fallaciouſly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, the Aſſertors of the publick Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65909:68"/>that followed thoſe Trayterous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves) which, ſo much diſcontented the Generality of the People, who were now, for the moſt part undeceived, of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which had been cunningly ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, of the Kings Averſeneſs to hearken to his Parliaments, that after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fruitleſs Petitions for a Compoſure, and Treaty with the King, from ſeveral Counties, in the delivery whereof to the Houſes, ſome of the Petitioners, as of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> were killed, and wounded, and ſent home otherwiſe unanſwered; they reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to try another way, and have Recourſe to Arms.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65909:69"/>by their Body at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> were for the moſt part cut off, and the Town gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereupon, the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> with 3000 men, marched haſtily to <hi>Black heath,</hi> and from thence, ferryed and ſwam over the greateſt part of his Army into <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſide, and quartered at <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Stratford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being there, he met with this Noble Heroe Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons of Honour and Quality, as, the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> Lord <hi>Loughborough,</hi> with a compleat Body of reſolved men, with whom, after they had skirmiſhed with ſome Parliament Horſe at <hi>Mile-end,</hi> they marched to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> where they ſeized the Committee; and thence, to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> a Town defenceleſs, and inconſiderable, as was generally ſuppoſed, both by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Adjacent Parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, either to receive by a proviſional way of Relief any great Force into it, or by reaſon of the untenable Condition of it, to hold out any time, if they ſhould venture to take up or ſtay there. Yet ſo conſtantly couragious, vigilant, and incredibly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, were theſe Loyally diſpoſed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as this Town, which by reaſon of the inpreparation of Neceſſaries, could
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65909:69"/>not probably hold out againſt ſo potent and terrible an Enemy, the ſpace of one week; continued 3 Moneths, in a moſt reſolute Defiance and reſiſtance of a Victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my glutted with ſuch variety of Conqueſts, and ſupplied with ſuch freſh and continual Recruits, to accompliſh thoſe unjuſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and Trophies, which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to rear upon the Ruines of the whole Kingdom: But at length after many ſtout Endeavours, in Sallies, Eruptions, and perpetual Firings gallantly performed, the Loyal Garriſon having eaten up all their Horſes, the Dogs and Cats, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (though moſt reluctant to Nature, being ſweetned with Prunes, and ſome other Fruit and Spice, whereof ſome ſtore was found in the Town at their Coming) could afford them nouriſhment; was compelled to come to a Capitulation (though it was bravely reſolved the night before, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt breaking through, which was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſable) by which it was concluded, the Town ſhould be ſurrendred upon theſe hard conditions, the Officers at Mercy, and the Souldiery upon Quarter for Life.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of theſe hard Conditions, and their ſtanding out ſo long, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned them, was threefold. The firſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65909:70"/>was, That not only the County wherein they were beſieged, but moſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England</hi> had engaged themſelves, that they would joyn with, and Aſſiſt them in the buſineſs; but all thoſe Mountains of Promiſe came to nothing, an inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Party appearing about <hi>Saffron Walden,</hi> being routed by Major <hi>Sparrow.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and which ſeemed more probable, was the hopes they had from <hi>London,</hi> a great many Perſons of Quality, and known Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts therein, having liſted themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> who had with him in that Action, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> the Lord <hi>Francis Villers,</hi> and others; theſe appeared at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> in a formidable manner, but were preſently ſuppreſt by Sr. <hi>Michael Liveſey,</hi> and the aforeſaid Lord <hi>Francis,</hi> bringing up the Rear, was there killed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the Quarter offered from Rebels, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> fled to St. <hi>Neats</hi> in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> where his Quarters were beaten up, by Col. <hi>Scroops</hi> Regiment of Horſe, where Col. <hi>Dalbeir</hi> was ſlain; and himſelf taken Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle. The third and chiefeſt Reaſon, which induced them to the continuance of the Siege, was their daily Expectation of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65909:70"/>the Advance of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>England,</hi> and to whom were joyned a number of Gallant Perſons, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the King, throughout the War, Commanded by Sr. <hi>Marmaduke,</hi> now Lord <hi>Langdale.</hi> Over this Kirk-Army, Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was made General, a Perſon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of all hands, and of whom, and his ſucceſs, his Majeſty, it is ſaid, very much deſponded, when firſt he had notice of his Commanding in Chief. And ſo it fell out; for, at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> Lieut. Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> met with this Army, and with 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>000 men, totally defeated them; ſo that <hi>Hamilton</hi> was forced to fly, and was taken by the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Grooby,</hi> at <hi>Uttox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and brought Priſoner to <hi>London,</hi> where, as Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he was afterwards for this buſineſs beheaded. But I venture not to Canonize him a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colcheſter</hi> being thus defeated of all hopes of Relief, rendred it ſelf to the Victors, and 5 hours after the Surrender, according to a Decree of a Council of War, enſued the death of theſe two Noble Perſons, being deſtined by them to be ſhot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65909:71"/>was nothing elſe, but their ſuperlative Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and their fixedneſs of Duty towards the King, in whoſe Cauſe and Defence, they aſſured themſelves, they would never be wanting, as long as their Breath would laſt, were the Difficulties and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of doing it, never ſo greats, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. An Honourable Enemy would have ſcorned ſo unwarrantable and impotent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and for which, the Names of ſome Perſons will ſtink for ever.</p>
            <p>But never was the Meſſage of Death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by any with more Magnanimity, and undaunted Reſolution and Bravery of mind, both the Roman, and Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſtriving to Excellency in this harſh Encounter with an unexpected Death: Sr. <hi>Charles</hi> was the firſt by deſignation, to be ſacrificed to their Cruelty, who having retired himſelf a while, to offer up his laſt Prayers to God, commending his Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, preſented himſelf to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners, and tearing open his Doublet, expoſed his naked Breaſt, ſaying aloud, <hi>Now Rebels do your worſt;</hi> and ſo by their murdering Bullets was diſpatched in the place.</p>
            <p>Sr. <hi>George Liſle</hi> was appointed to be next in this Tragedy, of whom, take
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65909:71"/>this brief Account: He was extracted from a Gentile Family in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and from the beginning of the Troubles, had ſtrenuouſly and couragiouſly aſſiſted the King: The moſt remarkable place (ſaving this of his Death) where his great Spirit, and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry experience moſt manifeſted it ſelf, was at the ſecond <hi>Newberry</hi> Battel, where he made good his ground, being Col. of a Regiment of Foot, againſt ſeveral Charges both of Horſe and Foot, of the Enemy, who did all they could, to drive him from ſome Advantages, which, could they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by ſubduing that handful of men, might have facilitated their way to Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This he ſuſtained, with an Invincible Reſolution, animating his Souldiers, and leading them on without any Supplies or Reſerves, ſeveral times, and for the more Encouragement, took off his own Doubler, and charged in his Shirt, bidding them, come on once more for the King, then for the Prince, then for the Duke, till ſuch time as night came, and quitted him from his hot Service and Enemies together. This noble Action was taken notice of by the K. &amp; acknowledged ſo at Court, which rendred him deſervedly famous among the Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his own Party, and as dreadful to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65909:72"/>the other, ſo that having him in their hands, by this Surrender, they reſolved, to be thus cowardly and baſely rid of him.</p>
            <p>It being, as was ſaid before, his turn to die; ſeeing and beholding that ſad Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the dead Body of his deareſt Friend, he fell upon it, and kiſſed it, as if he meant to breath into it another Soul; and with a free and full, yet true Relation of his Vertues, and Endowments, he did often repeat theſe words, <hi>In how ſhort a moment has a brave Spirit expired! well, this Priority was due to thee, but I ſhall not be long behind thee, my Death which is now at hand, ſhall reſtore thee to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, ſtanding up, and taking five Pieces of Gold out of his Pocket, he gave one to his Executioners, and the other four he ſent to four Friends in <hi>London,</hi> and then addreſſing himſelf to the ſtanders by, he ſaid, Oh, how many do I ſee here about me, whoſe Lives I have ſaved in hot bloud, and now muſt mine be taken away moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in cold bloud! Sure the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of among the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> or the very Barbarians, in any Age. After which words, ſome ſhort Ejaculations, and ſome few Invocations upon the name of Jeſus, as he ſtood in an unconquerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65909:72"/>of mind, and in an Heroick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, he was alſo diſpatched by the ſame hands.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe 2 ſtars of the firſt Magnitude, for valourous Loyalty, were put out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, by the malice of their Enemies; but though they ſhine not here, in that ſplendor, which their deſired Lives would have appeared in, yet they ſhine in a full Luſtre, in that Region of Glory, whither the Violence of their Enemies tranſplanted them.</p>
            <p>Moſt certain it is, that upon the Ground where Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> fell when he was ſhor, there hath grown no graſs, where the Print of his Body was, it remaining ſtill bare, though it be green round about; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the unreaſonable, unjuſt, and cruel uſage of ſo brave a perſon; and if the Earth be puniſhed, that groan'd at their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end, how much more heavy will their puniſhment be, that contrived, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced at it?</p>
            <p>Since the Reſtitution of his Majeſty, the corps of theſe <hi>Worthies</hi> have been taken up, and with all due Magnificence, attended by the Gentry thereabouts, and the Mayor, and other principal perſons of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Repoſitories of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

            <p>His Death was too lamentably publick, but the cauſe for which he died was not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, wherefore we will pay theſe juſts and dues to his memory in a brief na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, of the latter part of his honourable life.</p>
            <p>In the year 1648, when Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <hi>Langhorne,</hi> Collonel <hi>Poyer,</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> took up Arms in <hi>Wales</hi> for the King, this Gentleman out of his Senſe of the Kings and Kingdoms miſery, the ruine and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge daily committed on the Church, freely engaged with the ſaid perſons for the reſtoration of the Laws, and his Soveraign. But it pleaſed God not to ſucceed that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; ſo that at St. <hi>Fagon</hi>'s that Loyal Army of <hi>Welch</hi> men was defeated by the Parliament Forces, under Collonel <hi>Horton,</hi> from whence the remaines of that field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to <hi>Pembroke</hi> Town, which being well fortified and provided, held the Army now recruited with Forces, under <hi>Cromwell</hi> a three-months Siege, but ſeeing no hopes of relief, after a hard defence made, the Garriſon render'd themſelves upon Articles, the main whereof, and to our purpoſe, were, that the three Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels above named, ſhould be at mercy, all other Officers <hi>to depart the Kingdom for three years, not to return before, upon pain of death,</hi> and the private Souldiers to go home, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging not to bear Arms againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>In the Article of departing the Kingdom, this valarous Gentleman was concernd, who ſeeing the diſtracted eſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

            <p>Being therefore in <hi>London</hi> upon the ſame deſign (in defiance of thoſe forced Articles, which contrary to all Law, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht a Subject from his Country, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty, and would expoſe him to the mercy of other Climates for his affection to his own) he was betrayed and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and preſently after condemned by a Council of War, for contrarying the ſaid Capitulation, and as a preparatory <hi>Offering</hi> to that great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the King, which followed in the next moneth; he was ſhot to death againſt St. <hi>Faith</hi>'s Door, a good and ſuitable prop to ſuch conſtant Loyalty, which he reſolutely maintained to his laſt, and ſo bravely expoſed himſelf to their bullets.</p>

            <p>I Intend not to write the Hiſtory of this Pious Prince, ſo excellently and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly drawn by himſelf, and thoſe who have traced his memorials and remains, not taking a far proſpect of him, which was fair, and beautiful, and pleaſant in the beginning of his Reign, but viewing neerer at hand, the black and diſmal cloud, which wrapt up and enveloped his ſetting glories, now by Divine Juſtice and favour riſen again to their full and radiant luſtre.</p>
            <p>We ſhall retroſpect no further than the beginning of the <hi>Scotch</hi> War, at which time the Symptomes of a general Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion firſt appeared. For what the <hi>Scots</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly implyed in their undutiful Papers, Declarations and Remonſtrances, was ſoon after avowedly inſiſted on, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65909:75"/>Faction of the long Parliament. The King was loaded with an heavy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being led by evil Councellors, that their deſign was to introduce Popery, to erect an arbitrary Government, as in the buſineſſe of Ship-money, Patents, and Monopolies. That he declined Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the boundaries of his unlimited Prerogative, to the great burden and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Subjects. No ſooner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had he compoſed the <hi>Scotch</hi> War, but to take away and remove all jealouſie and diſtruſt of him in his People (though all along his Reign he had found ſome popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar leading Grandees to be the untractable and unſatisfiable Enemies of his Kingdoms Peace) he ſummoned his laſt, the long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>November</hi> 1640, which by a gracious Act of his, was not to be diſſolved or prorogued without their own conſent; and if that ſhould ſo determine, a Bill alſo was ſigned by him for a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iennial or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Parliament, that ſo his Subjects might reſt confident and aſſured in the due manage and adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But theſe favours gave the Faction no other ſatisfaction, then that they ſaw they might preſume to add other demands;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65909:76"/>and by how much more gracious his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was to them, they judged they might be the more impudent towards him; in which they failed not a tittle, daſiring, as their only ſafety from the danger of the Prerogative, the Militia in their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, the only defence, and the unſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right of his Crown.</p>
            <p>To attain this, they moſt inſolently by their partiſans in the City, tumult him at his Court at <hi>White-hall,</hi> from which to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void both the danger and diſhonour that rebel rout threatned, he was compelled to withdraw, to ſee if by his abſence that rage and madneſſe might be allayed, and the two Houſes ſet at freedom, which by his preſence was the more enflamed, and the Priviledge of Parliament proſtituted to the licentious and mad frenzy of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>But this afforded them their deſired advantage, from hence they calumniate the King, that ſince he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Parliament, he would invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date their Authority, and render them uſeleſſe and unſerviceable to thoſe great ends, for which they were called, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to concur with them, and departing from that his great Council. With theſe and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65909:76"/>ſuch like ſuggeſtions they ſo filled the minds of men, who were prediſpoſed, by ſome former diſcontents, and who had their Authority (through ſome diſuſe of it) in great reverence, that every where, but eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> parties were framed, intelligencies and correſpondencies held; Divers Petitions preſented in the purſute of theſe deſigns to the Parliament, offering to ſtand by them with their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to the attainment of thoſe ends held forth in their Declarations and Reſolves, which in concluſion were ſummed up in that unhappy Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdom, by the Lords and Commons remaining at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> divers of both Houſes, either out of fear of the rabble, or conſcience of their duty, abſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves, and retired home, or followed the King's Fortune, who having traverſed ſome ground about <hi>London</hi> from one of his Royal Palaces to another, in hope the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper would abate, and the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their reaſon and obedience toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; at laſt finding his hopes fruſtrated, by more unreaſonable demands, every meſſage to him from the two Houſes came burdened with, he reſolved to go for <hi>York,</hi> and ſecure his Magazine at <hi>Hull.</hi> But
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65909:77"/>Sr. <hi>John Hotham</hi> being newly ſent thither by the Parliament, refuſed the Kings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into that Town, unleſs himſelf, with ſome few of his retinue would pleaſe to enter; the King paſſionately complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this to the Parliament, but with as little redreſs, as his demand of Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Authors of the Tumults, this was the Inrroduction to thoſe after violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Royal Perſon and Authority.</p>
            <p>For the Parliament forthwith raiſed an Army, under the command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the County of <hi>York</hi> humbly profeſſed themſelves to the Service of his Majeſty; whereupon <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 22, 1642. he ſet up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> whence, after he had marched into <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and having raiſed a conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thereabouts, was on his way to <hi>London,</hi> he was overtaken by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> at a place called <hi>Edge Hill,</hi> where enſued a fierce Fight, with equal loſs on both ſides, <hi>October</hi> 23, 1642. where God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to cover the Kings head in the day of Battel, and permit him to fall by their execrable hands, in the time of Peace, to which he ſo often ſolicitouſly woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d them. In their Generals Commiſſion, they had tyed him up with a limitation, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65909:77"/>of the Kings Perſon, but left their bullets at random. A ſubtil time-ſerving diſtinction between the Cannon and the Axe, which afterwards they trayterouſly lifted up againſt his Annoynted and ſacred Head.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, to ſtrengthen their Cauſe, treat with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and for the better mutual aſſurance, and to difference their abettors and fautors from the Kings Leige People, as well as to lay a baite for all ſacrilegious and covetous minded men, to invite them to ſupplies of money in this rebellion, enter into a Solemn League and Covenant, the main deſign whereof, was the utter extirpation (as previous and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Kings deſtruction) of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and the eſtabliſhed Government of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Popery being added alſo for the greater colour of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, againſt which the King iſſued forth his Royal Proclamation, laying open the miſchievous deſign thereof, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to maintain the Religion, ſo long and ſo happily profeſſed, and ſealed by the blood of ſo many Martyrs, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to which glory and Crown far above all his other Diadems, this Defender of the Faith, was through ſo many future ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to aſpire.</p>

            <p>This came very ſeaſonably into the World, as to the Proteſtant part of it,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65909:80"/>who never imagined or thought Subjects of their perſwaſion, would take up Arms, or reſiſt without ſome grievous alteration in Religion, though they condemn it in any caſe whatſoever, and therefore the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant States abroad did wholly decline their owning of them, though they did nothing poſitively for the Kings aſſiſtance, which by this means he could not rationally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to himſelf from the Catholick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who would not engage without ſome great advantages for his Popiſh Subjects, againſt which his Majeſty was ſo religiouſly reſolved, though he were moſt dutifully and cordially ſerved by them throughout the War.</p>
            <p>To reſume our narrative, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was all in a flame, the Sectaries eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where finding Friends to their ſpecious <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and having the City of <hi>London</hi> for their inexhauſtible Magazine, and ſupplies of men, money, and Arms.

            <p> I cannot but obſerve, before I come to repeat the perpetration of all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated miſchief in his murder, how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually his enemies forſook their allegiance; and how the paint of their religious and loyal pretences wore off by time, which will leave their fair-faced impiety indelible. Firſt, their General muſt go fight with the Kings Army, and reſcue him from his evil Councellors, but preſerve his Perſon; this Riddle was reſolved in my Lord <hi>Fairfaxes</hi> Commiſſion (when they had ſo far engaged their partakers, that there was no way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from thoſe dangerous courſes) where there was not ſuch a word, but kill and ſlay without exception. During the War all their importunate deſires were, that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to disband his Army, and return to his moſt dutiful Subjects at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> afterwards towards the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War, when he urged what they had ſo vehemently obteſted, they were moſt ungraciouſly diſpleaſed at the propoſal; and ſo proceeded in concluſion to that heighth of impiety, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks of another curſed caytiffe, <hi>Ferox ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerum quia prima provenerant,</hi> their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in one wickedneſſe provoking them to more.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:65909:81"/>
            <p> For the King being every where worſted and beſieged in his Chief Garriſon, the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was adviſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to caſt himſelf upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, then lying at the Siege of <hi>Newark:</hi> The News of his Departure from <hi>Oxford,</hi> was no ſooner known to the Parliament, but ſuppoſing he would come to <hi>London,</hi> and rely upon the Affections of the City, (who were reclaimed from thoſe wild Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies, by having emptied thoſe veins of Wealth which were expended in the War, and at laſt found themſelves never the nearer thoſe things they fought for, but were every day affronted, both by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Army) therefore they cauſed it to be proclaimed, that it ſhould be Treaſon for any to harbour the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (which makes every place of his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a Court, and a kind of Sanctuary) and thereupon, the Lord Mayors Houſe was ſearched, as for a Malefactor. Oh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Impudence of Subjects to their Soveraign!</p>
            <p>But they were quickly eaſed of this fear, by an Expreſſe from their Commiſſioners in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, that he was arrived there: This put them upon new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; ſo they agree, if they could not get
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65909:81"/>him out of their hands by Treaty, to obtain him by purchaſe, as our Saviour was ſold before by his own. And very ſatyrical, if true (as it is reported to be) was that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Monſieur <hi>Bellieure,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (who came to the King, then at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>) upon his diſmiſſing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy that brought him into the Parliament Quarters, having a half Crown in his hand, he asked one of the Souldiers, how much it was that <hi>Judas</hi> ſold our Saviour for, who replying 30 Pieces of Silver, juſt ſo much, ſaith he, take among you, for ſelling your Lord and Maſter, and therewith gave him the half Crown; in concluſion, for 200000 Pounds the King was bargained for, and brought by the Order of the Parliament, who ſent Commiſſioners to attend him to <hi>Holmby,</hi> one of his own Houſes, where he was ſo ſtrictly guarded, that none of his Friends, nor his Servants, but who muſt paſſe the Allowance of the Two Houſes, were permitted to wait upon him, &amp; they were very few, and inconſiderable beſides.</p>
            <p>Being thus lockt up, and waiting the Pleaſure of the Parliaments Conſideration of him, who minded him no more, then as if he had been one of their Fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he was in the night time hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65909:82"/>from thence, by Cornet <hi>Joyce,</hi> June 4. 1647. to <hi>Childerſley,</hi> thence, to <hi>New-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> thence, to <hi>Royſton,</hi> to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> to <hi>Caveſham,</hi> to <hi>Maydenhead,</hi> to <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> to <hi>Stoke,</hi> to <hi>Oatlands,</hi> to <hi>Sion</hi> Houſe, and laſtly, to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> being forced to ſhift his Abode at the pleaſure of the Army, who near his Perſon, with feigned Overtures of Loyalty, and as in order to his Safety and Service, kept alwaies their Head Quarters, when the Deſign was meerly by his Preſence with them (of ſo great Reverence and Concernment are, and ought to be Princes, though devoyded of all Power, both in Rebels and Subjects eſteem, as the King himſelf excellently in his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> obſerved in this juncture) to counterbuffe and balance the unlimited uſurped Power of the Parliament, and to ſhew them that they might not expect to be abſolute or maſterleſs, as long as Intereſt and the Sword could ſerve them.</p>
            <p>Thus was the King driven about, having no place to reſt his Head in, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not with diverſity of ſad thoughts and cares, till for ſome time, the ſpace of three Moneths, he remained, and was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> in ſome ſhew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. During which time, ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65909:82"/>and Diſputes aroſe between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Army, who then appeared as the Kings Friends, but in truth were no ſuch matter, but uſed his Name (as the Parliament did, in the beginning of the War) to ſhrowd their Trayterous deſigns againſt him, and to ſtrengthen the weak beginning of their Future projected At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as the Parliament afterwards in their declination, to bring up themſelves, and that Reſpect, Veneration and eſteem they had ſo wretchedly forfeited, the King ſerving only as the Beam, to the Scales and Balances of each Faction and Party, which, for a while went up and down, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſing each other, till at laſt the heavy and ſad weight of the Armies Faithleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unparallel'd diſloyalty, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, brought him down to his Grave.</p>
            <p>For the King having ſtaid at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, about the time afore ſpecified, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the Propoſitions of the Parliament, who were inſtantly and unceſſantly called upon by the People, for a ſpeedy Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Compliance with his Majeſty, the Grandees of the Army thought it high time to obviate the happy Opportunities of a Settlement, which they ſaw all good men ſo deſirous of, by the Kings Reſidence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65909:83"/>any longer near the City of <hi>London,</hi> with whom they had lately had a Bickering, and through which, they had inſolently in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph marched, to the Affront and Regret of the Citizens, the Grugde whereof, they well knew, was yet freſh and recent, and wanted but the Advantage of the Kings Perſon and Preſence.</p>
            <p>Therefore with deviliſh Policy, by an Inſtrument and Engine of their own, Col. <hi>Whaley,</hi> they give the King, a kindly (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) Notice and Information, of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Aſſaſſinate intended againſt his Perſon, if he ſhould venture to ſtay any time longer at this his Mannour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of Duty and Affection, earneſtly wiſht and obteſted his Majeſty, to conſult and provide for his ſafety elſewhere.</p>
            <p>This ſudden news, weighed with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Circumſtances, and the paſſionate manner of the Diſcovery, and the King being in the cuſtody of a moſt perdite ſort of men, begot a Reſolution of ſpeedily withdrawing himſelf from the Danger. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, how many Vexations and Miſeries did this good Prince paſs, in his way and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to more! Theſe men that reſolve to murder him publickly, make this impudent Eſſay of his Courage and Patience, by a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65909:83"/>counterfeited Parricide to be perpetrated privately.</p>
            <p>By this <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the King is wrought out of this ſecure and advantageous Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by a ſwift flight, in company with Two of his Servants, recovered the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where Col. <hi>Hammond</hi> (Brother to the moſt Loyal, and Reverend Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and whoſe Father was one of the Phyſitians to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and therefore the rather confided in) was Governour for the Parliament. At his Departure from <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, he left behind him a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which for its ſad and penſive matter, but yet (as himſelf in a Cloud) reflected with Majeſtick Rayes of pietcing Elegance, wherewith the Spirit of that good Prince was over-burdened and diſtreſt) I have thought fit to inſert.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65909:84"/>call God and the World to witneſs, with what patience I have endured a tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; which ſo long as I had any hopes, that this ſort of my Suffering might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the peace of my Kingdoms, or the hindring of more effuſion of Bloud, I did willingly undergoe; but now finding by too certain proofs, that this my continued Patience would not only turn to my perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine, but likewiſe be of much more prejudice, then furtherance to the publick good; I thought I was bound, as well by natural as political Obligations, to ſeek my ſafety, by retiring my ſelf for ſome time, from the publick view both of my Friends and Enemies: And I appeal to all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men to judge, if I have not juſt cauſe to free my ſelf from the hands of thoſe who change their Principles with their condition; and who are not aſhamed openly to intend the deſtruction of the Nobility, taking away their negative voice; and with whom the Levellers Doctrine is rather countenanced then puniſhed: And as for their Intentions to my perſon, their changing, and putting more ſtrict Guards upon me, with the diſcharging moſt of all thoſe Servants of mine, who formerly they willingly admitted to wait upon me, doth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65909:84"/>ſufficiently declare. Nor would I have this Retirement miſſe-interpreted; for I ſhall earneſtly and unceſſantly endeavour the ſetling of a ſafe and well-grounded Peace, wherever I am, or ſhall be, &amp; that as much as may be without the effuſion of more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Bloud; for which, how many times have I deſired, preſt to be heard, and yet no ear given to me?

            <p>Whereupon, the very day the Treaty ended, of which they had as ſure intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as the Houſes, they put on their Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical vizor of piety, and kept a Faſt by themſelves, to ſeek for (that they never found) a bleſſing in their Counſels, which were in ſpight of an Oracle to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to murther and deſtroy, ſacrilegiouſly, and rebelliouſly to ſeize on the goods and Eſtates of the King, the Clergy, and all Loyal Subjects.</p>
            <p>The effect of their Prayers ſhewed to whom they were directed, for immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and violently, as if acted by Satanical impulſes, (while the Houſe was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and debating the Kings condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were but juſt come to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of acknowledging the Kings Grace and favour in his condeſcentions in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Treaty, as may be ſeen at large in Mr. <hi>Prins</hi> Speech to his eternalhonour;) they fall upon the Parliament <hi>December</hi> 6, 1648. ſeclude above 140 Members, drive away through fear of their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65909:89"/>many others, and pack up a Juncto of the remaining Members, to ſerve their own deſigns and cruel, ignorant Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Herein how obſervable is it, that God ſuffered not the Kings moſt righteous Cauſe, to paſs unevidenced and juſtified by its adverſaries, that how gloomy ſoever it were in riſing and in its courſe, yet it ſhould ſet in glory, and have ſome kind of acknowledgment, though wrapt up in the ambiguous obſcure words of that Treaty from its very Enemies, who having their eyes opened, would, when too late, have found the way to our and their common Peace: and greater Teſtimony cannot be given.</p>
            <p>The King, as was partly ſaid before, was now delivered into the hands of Collonel <hi>Ewers, Hammond</hi> ingratefully as diſloyally betraying the bountiful Patron and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of his family, and contrary alſo to the orders of Parliament, into the hands of the Army; who conveyed him out of the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> to <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> where they firſt began their barbarous and ruder incivilities.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hurſt Caſtle</hi> the King was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where the poor loyal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65909:90"/>according to cuſtom, or to hold up the reputation of that Majeſty, which thoſe fellows ſo ſcornfully and ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed, cauſed the bells to be rung; the Mayor, and his Brethren the Aldermen going out of Town to meet the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of a Troop of Horſe in the miry way, would have preſented him the keys of that his City, with the uſual ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but they were ſoon put from their duty, thrown in the dirt, and beaten for their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>December</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>From thence he was conveyed next day to <hi>Farnam,</hi> with the ſame Military Guards, and thence to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where they locked him up, and kept as ſtrickt and ſevere, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Guards upon him, intruding upon his devotions, upbraiding him with his condition, and moſt irreverently and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently profaning his Perſon within his hearing.</p>
            <p>He continued here untill he had kept his laſt Chriſtmaſs, but ſo privately, in the moſt retired rooms of that Caſtle, that no perſon, but of their appointment to look to him, was ſuffered to come near him, till after that the Army had furbiſht out a new Houſe of Commons, and prepared the deſign againſt his Sacred and moſt precious
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65909:90"/>Life, he was conveyed by Collonel <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> ſitting covered in the Coach with him, (though by Divine vengeance now bare-headed upon <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>) with a ſtrong Guard of Horſe to his Palace at St. <hi>James's,</hi> and there lodged by order from their <hi>Juncto</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> there to wait the direful preparations for his Tryal, advanced into ſome kind of method, and lickt into ſome ravenous form already.</p>
            <p>But what words ſhall we now uſe, what expiating ſenſe to expreſſe innocency, and without ſome taint of guilt, the ſlagiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this villany, we are about to relate? what exaggerations of crimes to ſignifie and declare this <hi>Accumulative Treaſon,</hi> a term firſt invented and created by the Authors of this miſchief, to weary and overburden that noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and moſt uſeful life, and now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht? That baneful Prophetical Oracle being without all doubt (and as the immediate direction of God to <hi>Fulfil</hi> the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the ſins of this Nation) ridd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this moſt deteſtable wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Herein we may behold at one view, all the miſeries and confuſions that befel the three Kingdoms, from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our troubles, whoſe large circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65909:91"/>and ambient circles of jealouſies and fears centred in this fatal buſineſs.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Caligula</hi> moſt bloodily wiſht, that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> (that extended to the Empire of the World) had but one neck, theſe cruel and impious perſons had the unhappy enjoyment of, for with this Royal Martyr fell the glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of theſe Nations, the people where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as if the blow had reached their neck too, ſtoopt and hung down their heads, as aſhamed and afraid to lift up their guilty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards angry Heaven.</p>
            <p>Never were there ſo many ſorrowful and dejected looks, ſo many ſad and oppreſſed hearts, as at this deplorable occaſion. Every man preſaged his private ruine from this of the Publick, except thoſe, whoſe aimes were upon it, and who had deſigned to themſelves, the profit of this Maxime, Kill and take <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, it ſeemed ſo barbarous, even to thoſe perſons who had inſtrumentally ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the grand deſign, which they thought reached not to this extent, that the <hi>Presbiteryan</hi> Miniſters in and about <hi>London,</hi> avowedly remonſtrated againſt it, and ſubſcribed their names, laying the ſin and impiety of any proſedure againſt the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65909:91"/>King at their door, declaring the miſchief that would inevitably follow thereupon; all which they inforced and urged alſo from their Covenant.</p>
            <p>While thus we would clear our ſelves, and particular men from this horrid blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltineſſe, how ſhall we wipe off the ſtain from the Proteſtant Religion; it being the impious doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome, That Princes by the Popes Authority may be depoſed and murthered.</hi> Foraign Churches of our profeſſion, have ſuffered much under this imputation, by the Papiſts themſelves upon this ſcore, &amp; therefore we will not omit this vindication here, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be written upon all our Churches, being this Royal Martyrs words, in his advice to our Soveraign, <hi>That he ſhould not be alienated from the Religion eſtabliſhed, through any of the injuries and reproaches thrown upon him in this Rebellion, for they were not Proteſtants that did them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed they lack names and terms for themſelves, and thoſe monſtrous facts they perpetrated, nor <hi>Turk</hi> nor <hi>Jew</hi> nor infidel will reach them, ſuch was the incomparable innocence, ſanctity and virtue of this Prince (and Heaven would have none but perfect Sacrifices) I refer the Reader therefore to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65909:92"/>that which ſhews them beſt, that which themſelves dared to publiſh in this matter, which in ſhort is this.</p>
            <p>There were three grand Intereſts that centred and combined in this fatal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, The firſt was that of <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> whoſe often dreamt-of Soveraignty, egged and provoked his ambition, now propt with the power of the ſword, put him upon deſperate invaſion of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Crown and Life. The ſecond, was that of the Republicans or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth men, whoſe great tempting ſin to this facinorous act and main ingredient was coverouſneſs, having deſigned to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Kings Revenue, and the Churches Patrimony. The third was the Fifth Monarchy Hereſie, in whom mad ambition, and pride, and inſatiable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of wealth and riches were at ſtriſe for ſuperiority, or elſe ſo well blended and mixt, that it was hardly diſcernable which made the faireſt ſhew in their political and pious claim of worldly power.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Factions thus agreed, hoping when the accurſed deed was done to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach one another, and attain their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ends, conſpired together, and by their joynt Counſels after they had turned
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65909:92"/>out the Parliament, and erected a ſelect Juncto, by their directions to theſe men, who were all parties concern'd in the ſhare of the Spoyl. A thing called an Act of Parliament having the Authority of ſome 50 Commons, ſome whereof were alſo diſſenters, (the generality of them being new elected Members by Writ of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the room of thoſe at <hi>Oxford</hi>) paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Houſe to bring the King to Tryal, having therein appointed a High Court of Juſtice, conſiſting of ſome 80 perſons, all intereſſed Grandees, to be the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which the King ſhould be charged of Divers Crimes, which I abhor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>This High Court of Juſtice, the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judicature, according to the power given by the ſaid Act, having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled firſt in the Painted Chamber, in order to ſet and braze their countenances, by ſtaring in one anothers faces, then ſwelled with Deviliſh guilt and malice, came in formality with their impudent Preſident to their pretended Court, erected at the further end of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> where the King ſoon after was brought and placed in his chair againſt the face of theſe effront Rebels. There they exhibited the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65909:93"/>charge, which the King refuſed to anſwer to, or acknowledge that rout for any kind of Authority, which he perſiſted in all the four times he was convened before them, and in concluſion (as before they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved) by colour of a judicial proceeding, was moſt trayterouſly ſentenced to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, to the aſtoniſhment and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grief of his three Kingdoms, and the horrour and ſhame of the Chriſtian World. I have thus tranſiently paſt over this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant buſineſs, becauſe it is ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably known, and publiſhed at large, in the black Tribunal, to which I reſer the amazed Reader.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65909:93"/>what I have ſpoken, were I alone in this caſe alone concern'd. But the duty I owe to God in the preſervation of the true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of My People, will not ſuffer Me at this time to be ſilent: For how can any free-born Subject of <hi>England</hi> call Life, or any thing he poſſeſſeth his own; if power without Right daily make new, and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the old fundamental Law of the Land? which I now take to be the preſent caſe. Wherefore when I came hither, I expected, that you would have endeavoured to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Me concerning thoſe grounds which hinder Me to anſwer to your pretended Impeachment; but ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will move you to it (though Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matives) yet I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot judge Me, nor indeed the meaneſt man in <hi>England;</hi> for, I will not (like you) without ſhewing a reaſon, ſeek to impoſe a belief upon My Subjects.</p>

                           </note> There is no proceeding juſt againſt any man, but what is warranted either by Gods Laws, or the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Laws of the Country where he lives. Now I am moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65909:94"/>that this dayes proceeding cannot be warranted by Gods Law, for on the contrary, the authority of obedience unto Kings is clearly warranted and ſtrictly commanded both in the Old and New Teſtament; which if denied, I am ready inſtantly to prove: and for the Queſtion now in hand, there it is ſaid, That <hi>where the word of a King is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> Eccleſ. 8.4. Then for the Laws of this Land, I am no leſſe confident, that no learned Lawyer will affirm, that an impeachment can lye againſt the King, they all going in His Name; and one of their Maximes is, <hi>That the King can do no wrong.</hi> Beſides the Law, upon which you ground your proceedings, muſt either be old or new: if old, ſhew it; if new, tell what Authority warranted by the fundamental Laws of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, which was never one it ſelf (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to judge: And it were full as ſtrange that they ſhould pretend to make Laws without King or Lords-Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                        <p> And admitting, but not granting, that the People of <hi>Englands</hi> Commiſſion could grant your pretended power, I ſee nothing you can ſhew for that; for certaintly you never asked the queſtion of the tenth man of the Kingdom, and in this way you manifeſtly wrong even the pooreſt Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if you demand not his free conſent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your pretended Commiſſion without the conſent at leaſt of the major part of every man in <hi>England,</hi> of whatſoever quality or condition, which I am ſure you never went about to ſeek; ſo far are you from having it. Thus you ſee that I ſpeak not for My own right alone, as I am your KING, but alſo for the true liberty of all My Subjects, which conſiſts not in ſharing the power of Government, but in living under ſuch Laws, ſuch a Government as may give themſelves the beſt aſſurance of their lives and propriety of their goods. Nor in this muſt or do I forget the Priviledges of both Houſes of Parliament, which this dayes proceeding doth not only violate, but likewiſe occaſion the greateſt breach of their publick Faith, that (I believe) ever was heard of, with which I am far from charging the two Houſes: for all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65909:95"/>crimes laid againſt Me, bear date long before this late Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in which I having concluded as much as in Me lay, and hopefully expecting the two Houſes agreement thereunto, I was ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and hurried from thence as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, upon which, I account I am againſt My will brought hither, where ſince I am come I cannot but to My power defend the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, together with My own juſt right; Than for any thing I can ſee the higher Houſe is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally excluded. And for the Houſe of Commons it is too well known, that the major part of them are detained or deterred from ſitting, ſo as if I had no other, this were ſufficient for me to proteſt againſt the lawfulneſſe of your pretended Court. Beſides all this, the Peace of the Kingdom is not the leaſt in my thoughts, and what hopes of ſettlement is there, ſo long as Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reigns without rule of Law, changing the whole frame of that Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which this Kingdom hath flouriſhed for many hundred years, (nor will I ſay what will fall out in caſe this lawleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt proceeding againſt me do go on) and believe it, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not thank you for this change, for they will
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65909:95"/>remember how happy they have been of late years under the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> the King my Father, and My Self, until the beginning of theſe unhappy Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and will have cauſe to doubt, that they ſhall never be ſo happy under any new. And by this time it will be too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly evident, that the Arms I took up, were only to defend the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, againſt thoſe who have ſuppoſed My power hath totally changed the ancient Government.</p>
                        <p>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons, why I cannot ſubmit to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority without violating the truſt which I have from God, for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and liberty of my People; I expect from you either clear Reaſons to convince my judgment, ſhewing me that I am in an Error (and then truly I will readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) or that you will withdraw your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>

He wiſhed me not to grieve and torment my ſelf for Him, for that would be a Glorious death that He ſhould die, it being for the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of this Land, and for maintaining the true Proteſtant Religion. He bid me read Biſh. <hi>Andrews</hi> Sermons, <hi>Hookers</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Policy, and Biſh. <hi>Lauds</hi> Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> which would ground me againſt Popery. He told me, He had forgiven all His Enemies, and hoped God would forgive them alſo; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, and all the reſt of my Brothers and Siſters, to forgive them. He bid me tell my Mother, that His thoughts never ſtrayed from Her, and that His Love
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65909:98"/>ſhould be the ſame to the laſt. Withal, He commanded me and my Brother to be obedient to her, and bid me ſend His Bleſſing to the reſt of my Brothers and Siſters, with commendation to all His Friends. So after he had given me His Bleſſing, I took my leave.</p>
                           <p>Further, He commanded us all to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe People, but never to truſt them; for they had been moſt falſe to Him, and to thoſe that gave them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and He feared alſo to their own Souls: and deſired me not to grieve for Him, for he ſhould die a Martyr, and that He doubted not, but the Lord would ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his Throne upon His Son, and that we ſhould be all happier then we could have expected to have been, if He had lived; with many other things, which at preſent, I cannot remember.</p>

               <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 30. (The Fatal Day) He was about 10 of the Clock brought from his Palace at St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on foot, (guarded with a Regiment of foot Souldiers) through the Park, with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65909:98"/>their Colours flying, and Drums beating, his private Guard of Partizans about him, D. <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> on one ſide, and Col. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> on the other, both bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, bidding them go faſter, ſaying, <hi>That he now went before them to ſtrive for an Heavenly Crown, with leſs ſolitude, then he had of tentimes bid his Souldiers to fight for an earthly Diadem.</hi> Being come to the end of the Park, he aſcends the ſtairs, leading to the long Gallery in <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Cabinet-Chamber,</hi> where he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed to lodge; there his Majeſty with the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> continued for ſome time in Devotion, and received the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament from the hand of the ſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; at which time, he read for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leſſon, the 27th. Chapter of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Goſpel, which contained the Hiſtory of the Death and Paſſion of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Communion ended, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty thanked the Biſhop for ſelecting ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and comfortable a Portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Biſhop modeſtly replied, no thanks was due to him, for it was the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appointed by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Church for the ſecond Morning Leſſon for that day, being <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. Here the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at his Devotion, refuſing to dine,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65909:99"/>only about twelve of the Clock, he eat a a Bit of Bread, and drank a Glaſs of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; from thence, about one a Clock he was accompanied by Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> and Col. <hi>Tomlinſon,</hi> and other Officers, formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend him, and the private Guard of Partizans, with Musketeers on each ſide, through the Banquetting-Houſe; adjoyning to which, the Scaffold was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, between <hi>VVhitehal</hi> Gate, and the Gate leading into the Gallery from S. <hi>James</hi>'s: The Scaffold was hung round with Black, the Floor covered with black Bayes, and the Axe and Block laid in the middle of the Scaffold. There were divers Companies of Foot of Col. <hi>Prides</hi> Regiment, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Troops of Horſe placed on the one ſide of the Scaffold towards <hi>Kings-ſtreet,</hi> and on the other ſide, toward <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> and the multitudes of people that came to be Spectators very great.

                     <note place="margin">King.</note> I Shall be very little heard of any body here, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a word unto you here: indeed I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think that holding my peace would make ſome men think, that I did ſubmit to the guilt, as well as to the puniſhment, but I think it is my duty to God firſt, and to my Country, for to clear my ſelf, both as an honeſt man, a good King, and a good Chriſtian. I ſhall begin firſt with my <hi>Innocency.</hi> In troth, I think it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful for me to inſiſt long upon this, for all the world knows that I never did begin a war with the two Houſes of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and I call God to witneſs, to whom I muſt ſhortly make an Account, That I never did intend for to incroach upon their Priviledges, they began upon me, it is the <hi>Militia</hi> they began upon, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the <hi>Militia</hi> was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me: and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65909:100"/>to be ſhort, if any body will look to the Dates of Commiſſions, of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and mine, and likewiſe to the Declarations, will ſee clearly, that they began theſe unhappy Troubles, not I: ſo that as the guilt of theſe Enormous crimes that are laid againſt me, I hope in God, that God will clear me of, I will not, I am in Charity, God forbid that I ſhould lay it upon the Two Houſes of Parliament, there is no neceſſity of either, I hope they are free of this guilt: for I do believe that ill Inſtruments between them and me, has been the chief Cauſe of all this bloudſhed: ſo that by way of ſpeaking, as I find my ſelf clear of this, I hope (and pray God) that they may too: yet for all this, God forbid that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian, as not to ſay that Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are juſt upon me: Many times he does pay Juſtice by unjuſt Sentence, that is ordinary. I will only ſay this, that an unjuſt Sentence * that I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to take effect,
<note place="margin">Strafford.</note> is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed now by an unjuſt Sentence upon me, this I have ſaid, to ſhew you that I am an Innocent man.</p>
                  <p>Now for to ſhew you that I am a good
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65909:100"/>Chriſtian, I hope there is
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pointing to Dr.</hi> Juxon.</note> a good man that will bear me witneſs, That I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given all the world, and even thoſe in particular that have been the chief cauſers of my death; who they are, God knows, I do not deſire to know, I pray God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them. But this is not all, my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt go further, I wiſh that they may repent, for indeed they have committed a great ſin in that particular. I pray God with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this be not laid to their Charge, nay, not only ſo, but that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdom; for my Charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me, not only to forgive particular men, but my Charity commands me to endeavour to the laſt gaſp the Peace of the Kingdom.
<note place="margin">Turning to ſome Gentlemen that wrote.</note> So(Sir)I wiſh with all my ſoul (and I do hope there is ſome here will carry it further)that they may endeavour the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Now (Sirs) I muſt ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in the way: firſt, you are out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet, as I could find by anything, is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65909:101"/>in the way of Conqueſt: certainly this is an ill way: for Conqueſt (Sir) in my opinion is never juſt, except there be a good juſt Cauſe, either for matter of Wrong, or juſt Title, and then if you go beyond it, the firſt quarrel that you have to it, is it that makes it unjuſt at the end, that was juſt at firſt: But if it be only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conqueſt, then it is a great Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as a Pirat ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the great Robber, he was but a Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Robber: And ſo, Sir, I do think the way that you are in, is much out of the way. Now, Sir, for to put you in one way, believe it, you will never do right, nor God will never proſper you, until you give God his due, the King his due (that is, my Succeſſors) and the People their due: I am as much for them, as any of you: You muſt give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church (according to his Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) which is now out of order: For to ſet you in a way particularly, now I cannot, but only this, <hi>A National Synod, freely called,</hi> freely debating among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt ſettle this: when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard.</p>
                  <p>For the King, indeed I will not <hi>(then turning to a Gentleman that touched the Ax)</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:65909:101"/>ſaid, Hurt not the Axe, that may hurt me
<note n="*" place="margin">Meaning, if he did blunt the edge.</note> For the King, the Laws of the Land will clearly inſtruct you for that, therefore, becauſe it concerns my own particular, I only give you a touch of it.</p>
                  <p>For the People, and truly I deſire their Liberty and Freedom as much as any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whoſoever, but I muſt tell you, that their Liberty and Freedom conſiſts in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Government, thoſe Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be moſt their own. It is not for having ſhare in Government (Sir) that is nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to them; A Subject and a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign are clean different things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore until they do that, I mean, That you do put the people in that Liberty as I ſay, certainly they will never enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sir, it was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an-Arbitrary way, for to have all Laws chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here, and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your Charge) that <hi>I am the Martyr of the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Introth Sirs, I ſhall not hold you much
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65909:102"/>longer, for I will only ſay this to you, that in truth I could have deſired ſome little time longer, becauſe I would have put this that I have ſaid in a little more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a little better digeſted then I have done, and therefore I hope you will excuſe me.</p>
                  <p>I have delivered my Conſcience, I pray God that you do take thoſe courſes that are beſt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own Salvations.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pointing to Dr.</hi> Juxon.</note> I think will witneſs it. <hi>Then turning to the Officers, ſaid,</hi> Sirs, excuſe me for this ſame, I have a good Cauſe, and I have a Gracious God, I will ſay no
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65909:102"/>more. <hi>Then turning to Col.</hi> Hacker, he ſaid, Take care they do not put me to pain. and Sir, this, and it pleaſe you. <hi>But then a Gentleman coming near the Axe, the King ſaid,</hi> Take heed of the Axe, pray take heed of the Axe. <hi>Then the King ſpeaking to the Executioner, ſaid,</hi> I ſhall ſay but very ſhort Prayers, and when I thruſt out my hands,—</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then the King called to Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> for his Night-cap, and having put it on, he ſaid to the Executioner, <hi>Does my hair trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you?</hi> who deſired him to put it all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Cap, which the King did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, by the help of the Executioner, and the Biſhop: then the King turning to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have a good Cauſe, and a Gracious God on my ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>D. <hi>Juxon.</hi> There is but one ſtage more, this Stage is turbulent and troubleſom, it is a ſhort one: But you may conſider, it will ſoon carry you a very great way: it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you from Earth to Heaven; and there you ſhall find a great deal of cordial Joy and Comfort.</p>
               <p>King. <hi>I go from a corruptible to an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crown; where no diſturbance can be, no diſturbance in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Juxon.</hi> You are exchanged from a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65909:103"/>Temporal, to an Eternal Crown, a good Exchange.</p>
               <p>The King then ſaid to the Executioner, Is my Hair well? Then the King took off his Cloak and his George, giving his George to Dr. <hi>Juxon,</hi> ſaying, Remember
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>It is thought, to give it to the Prince.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Then the King put off his Doublet, and being in his Waſtcoat, put his Cloak on again, then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Block, ſaid to the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>You muſt ſet it faſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Executioner.</hi> It is faſt, Sir.</p>
               <p>King. <hi>When I put my hands out this way, stretching them out, then—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that, having ſaid two or three words, (as he ſtood) to himſelf, with hands and Eyes lift up, immediatly ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, laid his Neck upon the Block: and the Executioner again putting his hair under his Cap, the King ſaid (thinking he had been going to ſtrike) ſtay for the ſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Executioner.</hi> Yes, I will and it pleaſe your Majeſty.</p>
               <p>And after a very little Pauſe, the King ſtretching forth his Hands, the Executioner at one blow ſevered his Head from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the head being off, the Executioner held it up, and ſhewed it to the People;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65909:103"/>which done, it was with the Body, put in a Coffin covered with black Velvet for that purpoſe, and conveyed into his Lodgings there: And from thence it was carried to his Houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where his Body was embalmed, &amp; put in a Coffin of Lead, laid there a Fortnight to be ſeen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and on the Wedneſday ſeven-night after, his Corps embalmed and coffined in Lead, was delivered chiefly to the care of four of his Servants, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> his Sewers; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Preſton,</hi> and <hi>John Joyner,</hi> formerly cook to his Majeſty; they attended with others, cloathed in Mourning Suits and Cloaks, accompanied the Herſe that night to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and placed it in that which was formerly the Kings Bed-Chamber; next day it was removed into the <hi>Deans Hall;</hi> which Room was hanged with Black, and made dark, with Lights burning round the Herſe; in which it remained till Three in the Afternoon, about which time came the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> having obtained an Order from the Parliament, for the Decent Interment of the King their Royal Maſter, provided the Expence thereof exceeded not five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>I cannot let paſs this Horrid Act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without letting the world know of the Damnable hypocriſie of that Arch Traytor <hi>Oliver Cromwel:</hi> The Day aſſigned for Murdering of the King being come, the Council of War ſate, which then managed all.

               <p>BY what hath been ſaid, you may ſee how long We have laboured in the ſearch of Peace. Do not you be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to tread thoſe waies in all thoſe worthy means to reſtore your ſelf to your Right; but prefer the way of Peace: ſhew the Greatneſs of your mind, rather to conquer your Enemies by pardoning them, then by puniſhing. If you ſaw how unmanly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly this implacable diſpoſition is in our ill-willers, you would avoid that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Cenſure Us not, for having parted with too much of Our own Right; the Price was great, the Commodity was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to Us, Peace to Our People. And We are confident another Parliam. would remember how uſeful a Kings Power is to a Peoples Liberty. Of how much We have
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65909:106"/>diveſted Our ſelf, that We and they might meet again in a due Parliamentary way, to agree the bounds for Prince and People. And in this give belief to our Experience, never to affect more Greatneſs or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then what is really and intrinſecally for the good of your Subjects (not ſatisfaction of Favorites.) And if you thus uſe it, you will never want means to be a Father to all, and a bountiful Prince to any you would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily Gracious unto. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all men truſt their Treaſure where it returns them Intereſt; and if Princes, like the Sea, receive and repay all the freſh ſtreams and Rivers truſt them with; they will not grudge, but pride themſelves to make them up an Ocean. Theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may make you a great Prince, as your Father is now a low one; and your ſtate may be ſo much the more eſtabliſhed, as mine hath been ſhaken. For Subjects have learnt (We dare ſay) that Victories over their Princes, are but Triumphs over themſelves, and ſo will be more unwilling to hearken to Changes hereafter. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Nation are a ſober People, however at preſent under ſome Infatuation. We know not but this may be the laſt time We
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65909:106"/>may ſpeak to you, or the world publickly; We are ſenſible into what hand We are faln, and yet We bleſs God, We have thoſe inward Refreſhments, that the malice of Our Enemies cannot perturb. We have learnt to own our ſelf, by retiring into Our ſelf, and therefore can the better digeſt what befals Us, not doubting but God can reſtrain our Enemies malice, and turn their fierceneſs into his Praiſe. To conclude, if God give you ſucceſs, uſe it humbly and far from Revenge: If he reſtore you to your Right upon hard conditions, whatever you promiſe, keep.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men which have forced Laws which they were bound to obſerve, will find their Triumphs full of Troubles. Do not think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in this world worth obtaining by foul and unjuſt Means. You are the Son of our Love: and as We direct you to what we have recommended to you, ſo we aſſure you, We do not more affectionately pray for you (to whom We are a Natural Parent) then We do, that the ancient Glory and Renown of this Nation, be not buried in Irreligion and Phanatick humour; And that all Our Subjects (to whom VVe are a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65909:107"/>Politick Parent) may have ſuch ſober Thoughts, as to ſeek their peace; in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, as it was eſtabliſhed ſince the Reformation in this Kingdom, and not in new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And that the ancient Laws, with the Interpretation according to known practiſes, may once again be an hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, that you may in due time go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and they be governed, as in the fear of the Lord.</p>

               <hi>The Lord</hi> Capel <hi>beheaded</hi> March 9. 1949. <hi>in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace yard,</hi> Weſtminſter.</head>
            <p>THis Noble Lord, Noble in his Life, nobler in his Death and Memory, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt in his Poſterity, who fill the trumpet of Fame, that ſummons all men to render them their deſerved honours, though he was not like ſome of our foregoing Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, <hi>viz.</hi> Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sr. <hi>George Liſle,</hi> murthered in the inſtant of the rendition of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> having quarter for life given him by the General, yet did not long ſurvive their hard fate, being brought with more ſolemnity (more perfidiouſneſs) though alike glory to his Death, which he ſuffered with a Chriſtian and (no <hi>Roman</hi> but <hi>Colcheſter</hi>) Spirit and reſolution.</p>
            <p>He was no great Captain, nor ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook ſuch a charge, ſerving without any ſignal command in his Majeſties Armies, though no doubt ſufficient thereto, yet he is no leſs to be eternized for his indeavours, his courage, conſtancy and faithful adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65909:108"/>to the King, when deſerted by a great part of the Nobility, parting with, and hazarding a great and ample Eſtate, which was ſequeſtred from him, and in concluſion laying down his life, ſo that he may juſtly be ſtiled, one of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, and his name ever to be honourably mentioned, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.6. <hi>The Righteous ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was Son and Heir to Sr. <hi>Arthur Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> of <hi>Hadham Hall</hi> in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> a Gentleman of Great Eſtate, and who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and followed the old mode of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, kept a Noble and bountiful Houſe, and ſhewed forth his Faith by his charity, extending it in ſuch abundant manner to the poor, that he was bread to the hungry, drink to the thirſty, eies to the blind, and legs the the ſame, ſo that he might juſtly be ſtiled Great Almoner to the King of Heaven.</p>
            <p>As this diffuſive charity and bounty ſpread it ſelf abroad, no leſs did his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive love and Paternal affection beſtow it ſelf on this his Son, whom he moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally educated, to a perfection in Learning, as his rich expreſſions and elegant ſtile in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65909:108"/>his Book Printed after his death, and in other letters do beſt evidence.</p>
            <p>Sr. <hi>Arthur</hi> dying, as this Noble Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited his Eſtate, ſo did he his Virtues, his pious bounty appearing ſo conſpicuous, that ſome envious perſons, who hate good works in others, becauſe they will do none themſelves, have maliciouſly traduced him as inclining to Popery. But as ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions amongſt perſons of underſtanding, ſignifie nothing more than the ſpeakers malice, ſo wrought it in others a deſerved commendation of this Noble Perſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe times (and our own are worſe) when Charity lay bed-rid, and Faith only and ſuch hungry notions were talkt of, whereas his Faith appeared by his works.</p>
            <p>From the degree of Knight the ancient Dignity of his Family, now advanced to the Earldom of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he was made Baron <hi>Capel,</hi> of <hi>Hadham,</hi> a little before the time the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> received his Tryal, which in this brave Lords conſcientious Judgment of himſelf, was his original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in <hi>foro coeli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the Rebellion and thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the King and Parliament, he conſtantly and faithfully adhered to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65909:109"/>his Majeſty, contributing both in purſe and perſon to his aid and aſſiſtance, being appointed in that time for his eminent wiſdom and prudence Councellour to the Prince by the King his Father, whom he abandoned not till the disbanding of my Lord <hi>Hopton's</hi> Army in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> from whence his Highneſs took ſhipping to <hi>Scilly,</hi> giving my Lord an honourable, but ſorrowful diſmiſſion and conge to return home and attend, (though his heroical mind ſpur'd him on to purſue) his moſt unworthy fate.</p>
            <p>For at his coming home upon thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, having ſcarce warmed himſelf there after his long abſence from thence, but ſome hopes appearing of the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration to his former Authority, by the coming in of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army, as alſo by the <hi>Welch</hi> Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the riſing of ſeveral Counties, who declared for the ſame purpoſe, he with a ſelect number of his friends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and ſervants, joyned himſelf with the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and others, who with a conſiderable Army were then in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and after a long Siege were forced to ſurrender their Garriſon of <hi>Colcheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:65909:109"/>
            <p> In the Articles of that rendition, this right noble Lord was included, and had quarter given him for life, though it was afterwards unhanſomly unſaid again by him that gave it, who left him, after his Parol given, to a High Court of Juſtice; upon this ſurrender he was committed to the Tower, where whilſt he remained, he endeavoured to eſcape, which he well ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but croſſing the water, through ſome diſcourſe he let fall, <hi>Jones</hi> the Waterman, conceiving what he was, upon his landing diſcovered him, had him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and committed again in order to his Tryal.</p>
            <p>In the middle of <hi>March</hi> 1648, he was brought before the ſaid High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where he ſaid enough in reaſon and juſtice to have cleared himſelf, inſiſting upon his Priviledge as a Peer, and claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefit of the Laws, which owned no ſuch arbitrary Power as this, againſt the life of any Subject, eſpecially a Noble Man, and in ſum denied their Juriſdiction, and pleaded his quarter given him as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid, but nothing would avail, they proceeded to Judgment, and with Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Sr. <hi>John Owen,</hi> ſentenced
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65909:110"/>him to be beheaded, which was executed accordingly on the ninth of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will now take a view of him after the tmie of his Condemnation, when he was to encounter and look Death in the face. He alwaies kept a very chearful and well compoſed temper of mind, which proceeded from true Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he would often ſay, it was the <hi>good God he ſerved, and the good cauſe he had ſerved for, that made him not to fear Death,</hi> adding, <hi>that he never had the temptation of ſo much as a thought to check him for his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this quarrel, for he took it for his Crown and glory, and wiſhed he had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ability, and better fortune to engage in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The afternoon before his ſuffering, he was a great while in private with a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, where bewailing, with that ſenſe which became a true, and not deſpairing penitent, the ſins of his life paſt, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt he could remember, was his voting my Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> death, which though, as he ſaid, he did without any malice at all, yet he confeſſed it to be a very great ſin, and that he had done it out of a <hi>baſe fear</hi> (his own words) of a prevailing party, of which he had very often and very heartily
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65909:110"/>repented, and was confident of Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for it. Then he deſired to receive the Bleſſed Sacrament before he dyed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this (being afraid of ſome danger to the Miniſter that attended him, for that work of Love) and ſome Conference in order to his preparation, both for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and his voyage, the Sacrament and his death, he deſired to go to Prayers, which being performed, he returned to his private devotions.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the day of his death, he deſired the Miniſter, who was with him before, to hear, and joyn with him in Prayers, which he did, for half an hour in an excellent method, very apt Expreſſions, and moſt ſtrong, hearty and paſſionate affections; Firſt confeſſing and bewailing his ſins with ſtrong cries and tears, then humbly and moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring Gods mercy through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt alone. Secondly, For his dear Lady and Children with ſome paſſion, but for her eſpecially with moſt ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, recommending them to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence with great confidence and affurance, and deſiring for them rather the bleſſings of a better life than of this. Thirdly, For the King, Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65909:111"/>And Laſtly, For his Enemies, with almoſt the ſame ardour and affection.</p>
            <p>After Prayer ended, my Lord of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and Sr. <hi>John Owen</hi> being ſent for, the Miniſter read the whole Office of the Church for Good Friday, and then after a ſhort Homily for the occaſion, he received the Sacrament again, in which action he behaved himſelf with great Humility, Zeal and Devotion.</p>
            <p>Being demanded after the receiving thereof how he found himſelf, he replyed very much better, ſtronger and cheerfuller for that heavenly repaſt, and that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to walk like a Chriſtian through the vale of death in the ſtrength of it. But he was to have an Agony before his Paſſion, and that was the parting with his Wife, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, now Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> his Son in Law, two of his Uncles, and Sr. <hi>T.C.</hi> eſpecially his parting with his deareſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which indeed was the ſaddeſt ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that could be. In which occaſion, as he could not chooſe but ſhew and confeſſe a little of humane frailty, yet even then, he did not forget both to comfort and counſel her, and the reſt of his friends; particularly in bleſſing the yuong Lord, he commanded him never to revenge his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65909:111"/>death, though it ſhould be in his power, the like he ſaid unto his Lady. He told his Son he would leave him a Legacy out of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, and that was this, <hi>Lord lead me in a plain path. For Boy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I would have you a plain honeſt man, and hate diſſimulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this was paſt, with much adoe his Wife and the reſt of his Friends were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to begone, and then being all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the Miniſter, he ſaid, <hi>Doctor, the hardeſt part of my work in this World is now paſt,</hi> meaning the parting with his Wife. Then he deſired the ſaid Miniſter to pray preparatively for his death, that in the laſt action he might ſo behave himſelf, as might be <hi>moſt for Gods Glory, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing of his dead Maſters memory, and his preſent Maſters ſervice,</hi> and that he might avoid the doing or ſaying of any thing, which might ſavour either of ambition or vanity. This being done, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed with the other two Lords, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with him to Sr. <hi>Robert Cottons,</hi> where the Miniſter ſtaid with him till he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Scaffold, whither the Guard of Souldiers permitted him not to come, ſo that my Lord took leave of him there.</p>
            <pb n="218" facs="tcp:65909:112"/>
            <p> The ſame day he died, he wrote this following Letter to his Wife.</p>

            <p>When the other two Lords were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, he was brought laſt to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, where he ſpake as followeth.</p>

               <hi>CAPEL.</hi> No, I have taken my leave of him: and perceiving ſome of his Servants to weep, he ſaid, Gentlemen, refrain your ſalves, refrain your ſelves; and turning to Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher,</hi> he ſaid, what? did the Lords ſpeak with their hats off, or no?</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:65909:113"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Col.</hi> Beech. <hi>With their Hats off: And then coming to the front of the Scaffold, he ſaid, I ſhall hardly be underſtood here, I think, and then began his Speech as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capel.</hi> The concluſion that I made with thoſe that ſent me hither, and are the cauſe of this violent death of mine, ſhall be the beginning of what I ſhall ſay to you: When I made an addreſs to them (which was the laſt) I told them with much ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that I would pray to the God of all mercies, that they might be partakers of his ineſtimable and boundleſs mercies in Jeſus Chriſt; and truly I ſtill pray that Prayer; and I beſeech the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forgive any injury they have done to me, from my Soul I wiſh it. And truly, this I tell you as a Chriſtian, to let you ſee I am a Chriſtian. But it is neceſſary I ſhould tell you ſomewhat more, that I am a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant: And truly, I am a Proteſtant, and very much in love with the profeſſion of it, after the manner as it was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England</hi> by the Thirty nine Articles; a bleſſed way of profeſſion, and ſuch an one as truly, I never knew none ſo good. I am ſo far from being a Papiſt, which ſome body have (truly) very unworthily at
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65909:113"/>ſome time charged me withall, that truly, I profeſs to you, that though I love Good Works, and commend Good Works, yet I hold they have nothing at all to do in the matter of Salvation; my Anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is this, <hi>That Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> that is that that I reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And truly ſomething I ſhall ſay to you as a Citizen of the whole World, and in that conſideration I am here condemned to die, truly contrary to the Law that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all the World, that is, the Law of the Sword: I had the protection of that for my life, and the honour of it, but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will not trouble you much with that, becauſe in another place I have ſpoken ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry largely and liberally about it. I believe you will hear by other means what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I uſed in that caſe: But truly, that, that is ſtranger, you that are Engliſh-men, behold here an Engliſh-man here before you, and acknowledged a Peer, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die by any Law of <hi>England,</hi> not by any Law of <hi>England;</hi> nay, ſhall I tell you more? (which is ſtrangeſt of all) contrary to all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> that I know of. And truly I will tell you, in the matter of the civil part of my death, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65909:114"/>the Cauſe that I have maintained, I die (I take it.) for maintaining the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, injoyned by God himſelf, which enjoyns reverence and obedience to Parents: All Divines on all hands, though they contradict one another in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral opinions, yet all Divines on all hands do acknowledge, that here is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Magiſtracy and Order; and certainly I have obeyed that Magiſtracy and that Order underwhich I have lived, which I was bound to obey: and truly, I do ſay very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that I do die here for keeping, for obeying that fifth Commandment given by God himſelf, and written with his own finger. And now, Gentlemen, I will take this opportunity to tell you, that I cannot imitate a better, nor a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity than his, that ſaid of himſelf, <hi>For ſuffering an unjuſt judgment upon another, himſelf was brought to ſuffer by an unjuſt judgment.</hi> Truly, Gentlemen, that God may be glorified, that all men that are concerned in it, may take the occaſion of it, of humble repentance to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it, I do here profeſs to you, that I did give my Vote to that Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> I doubt not but God Almighty hath waſhed that away with a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65909:114"/>more precious blood, the Blood of his own Son, and my dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and I hope he will waſh it away from all thoſe that are guilty of it: truly, this I may ſay, I had not the leaſt part nor degree of malice in doing of it; but I muſt confeſs again to Gods glory, and the accuſation of mine own frailty, and the frailty of my Nature, that truly it was unworthy Cowardize, not to reſiſt ſo great a torrent as carried that buſineſs at that time. And truly, this I think I am moſt guilty of, of not courage enough in it, but malice I had none; but whatſoever it was, GOD I am ſure hath pardoned it, hath given me the aſſurance of it, that Chriſt Ieſus his Blood hath waſhed it away; and truly, I do from my Soul wiſh, that all men that have any ſtain by it, may ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repent, and receive a remiſſion and pardon from God for it. And now, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we have had an occaſion by this intimation to remember his Majeſty, our KING, that laſt was; and I cannot ſpeak of him, nor think of it, but truly I muſt needs ſay, that in my opinion, that have had time to conſider all the images of all the greateſt and vertuouſeſt Princes in the World; and truly, in my opinion,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65909:115"/>there was not a more vertuous, and more ſufficient Prince known in the World, than our gracious King <hi>CHARLES</hi> that died laſt: God Almighty preſerve our King that now is, his Son; God ſend him more fortunate and longer dayes; God Almighty ſo aſſiſt him, that he may exceed both the vertues and ſufficiencies of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For certainly, I that have been a Councellour to him, and have lived long with him, and in a time when diſcovery is eaſily enough made, for he was young (he was about thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or ſixteen years of age) thoſe years I was with him, truly, I never ſaw greater hopes of vertue in any young perſon than in him; great judgment, great underſtanding, great apprehenſion, much honour in his nature, and truly a very perfect Engliſhman in his inclination; and I pray God reſtore him to this Kingdom, and unite the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms one unto another, and ſend a great happineſſe both to you and to him, that he may long live and Reign among you, and that that Family may Reign till thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come, that is, while all temporal power is conſummated: I beſeech God of his mercy give much happineſſe to this your King, and to you, that in it ſhall
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65909:115"/>be his Subjects, by the Grace of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Truly I like my beginning ſo well, that I will make my concluſion with it, that is, That God Almighty would confer, of his infinite and ineſtimable Grace and mercy, to thoſe that are the cauſers of my coming hither, I pray God give them as much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as their hearts can wiſh; and truly, for my part, I will not accuſe any one of them of malice, truly I will not; nay I will not think there was any malice in them: what other ends there is I know not, nor will I examine; but let it be what it will, from my very Soul I forgive them every one. And ſo the Lord of Heaven bleſſe you all, God Almighty be infinite in goodneſſe and mercy to you, and direct you in thoſe wayes of obedience to his Commands, to His Majeſty, that this Kingdom may be an happy and glorious Nation again, and that your King may be an happy King in ſo good and ſo obedient a people. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty keep you all, God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Kingdom, God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you all.</p>
            <p>Then turning about, and looking for the Executioner (who was gone off the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold) ſaid, which is the Gentleman? which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65909:116"/>is the man? Anſwer was made, He is coming; He then ſaid, Stay, I muſt pull off my Doublet firſt, and my Waſtcoat: and then the Executioner being come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold, the Lord <hi>Capel</hi> ſaid, O friend! prethee come hither: Then the Executioner kneeling down, the Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> ſaid, I forgive thee from my Soul, and not only forgive thee, but I ſhall pray to God to give thee all grace for a better life: There is five pound for thee; and truly, for my clothes, and thoſe things, if there be any thing due to you for it, you ſhall be fully recompenced: but I deſire my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may not be ſtripped here, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take notice of my body but my own Servants. Look you Friend, this I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of you, that when I lye down, you would give me a time for a particular ſhort Prayer.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65909:116"/>ſtench, ſtench this iſſue of blood; this will not do the buſineſs, God Almighty find out another way to do it. And then turning to one of his Servants, ſaid, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwin,</hi> I cannot ſee any thing that belongs to my Wife; but I muſt deſire thee and beſeech her to reſt wholly upon Jeſus Chriſt, to be contented and fully ſatisfied: and then ſpeaking to his Servants, he ſaid, God keep you; and Gentlemen, let me now do a buſineſs quickly, privately, and pray let mee have your prayers at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, that God would receive my Soul.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid, honeſt man, I have forgiven thee, therefore ſtrike boldly; from my Soul I do it.</p>
            <p>Then a Gentleman ſpeaking to him, he ſaid, Nay, prethee be contented, be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65909:117"/>quiet, good Mr. — be quiet.</p>
            <p>Then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid, Well; you are ready when I am ready, are you not? and ſtretching out his hands, he ſaid, Then pray ſtand off Gentlemen. Then going to the front of the Scaffold, he ſaid to the People, Gentlemen, though I doubt not of it, yet I think it convenient to ask it of you, That you would all joyn in Prayers with me, That God would mercifully receive my Soul, and that for his alone mercies in Chriſt Ieſus. God Almighty keep you all.</p>
            <p>Execut. <hi>My Lord ſhall I put up your hair?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capel.</hi> I, I, prethee do; and then as he ſtood, lifting up his hands and eyes, he ſaid, O God, I do with a perfect and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heart ſubmit to thy will: O God! I do moſt willingly humble my ſelf: and then kneeling down, ſaid, I will try firſt how I can Lye; and laying his head upon the Block, ſaid, Am I well now?</p>
            <p>Execut. <hi>Yes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then as he lay with both his hand, ſtretched out, he ſaid to the Executioner, Here lie both my hands out, when I lift up my hands thus [<hi>lifting up his right hand</hi>] then you may ſtrike.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65909:117"/>
            <p> And then after he had ſaid a ſhort Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he lifted up his right hand, and the Executioner at one blow ſevered his head from his body, which was taken up by his Servants, and put (with his body) into a coffin.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THis Lord in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, was his ſpecial favourite and peculiar friend; ſo that after that aſſaſſinate upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he was made Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> having been newly before from Baron <hi>Rich</hi> of <hi>Kenſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> raiſed to the Honour of the Earldom of <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſent Colleague with the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> in that ſplendid Embaſſy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> about the marriage of the Queen Mother.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe favours ſo freely conferred on him, ſo uncertain, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and unobligeable are the minds of men (for I cannot impute his ſiding with the Parliament to have been from any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt or diſlike he received from the King) eſpecially when Religion becomes the bone of contention; he was one of thoſe Lords
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65909:118"/>that remained at <hi>London,</hi> and made up a Houſe of Peers, although he never took up Arms, Command or Employment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his good Maſter and Soveraign.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the War ſceing how unreaſonably the Parliament perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in carrying on the War, being ſo often fruitleſly courted by the King to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, he and the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their part and quarrel, and eſcaped to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where finding not that kind and favourable reception they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being looked on ſhily by the Court there, eſpecially this Lord, he privately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to <hi>London</hi> again, having left a fair account of himſelf to the King.</p>
            <p>But when the War was ended, and the Parliament had refuſed to treat with his Majeſty, and ſo to ſettle the Kingdom, he then took up Arms in earneſt in the Kings behalf, being real and cordial on this his laſt undertaking, and engaged with him the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> Lord <hi>Francis Villers,</hi> and Lord <hi>Peter,</hi> who with a gallant company of men rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz'd at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where immediately Sr. <hi>Michael Liveſey</hi> ſet upon them, and routed them.

            <p>He continued there for the ſpace of ſix moneths in pretty good health, both of body and mind, but as ſoon as he heard of the murther of the King, his heart failed him, and ſickneſs ſeized on him, ſo that he never dawed day afterwards, nor could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſtir out of his chamber, lamenting the loſs of his gracious Maſter, and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his own violent diſſolution the ſame way, which being condemned by the ſame High Court of Iuſtice, with my Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> he ſuffered on the ſame Scaffold.</p>

               <p>IT is to no purpoſe (I think) to ſpeak any thing here. Which way muſt I ſpeak? And then being directed to the Front of the Scaffold, he (leaning over the Rayls) ſaid; I think it is fit to ſay ſomthing, ſince God hath called me to this place. The firſt thing which I muſt profeſs, is, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my Religion, and my Breeding, which hath been in a good Family, that hath ever been faithful to the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, in the which I have been bred, in the which I have lived, and in the which, by Gods Grace and Mercy I ſhall die. I have not lived according to that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation I had in that Family where I was born and bred. I hope God will forgive me my ſins, ſince I conceive it is very much his pleaſure to bring me to this place, for the ſins that I have committed. The cauſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65909:120"/>that hath brought me hither, I believe, by many hath been much miſtaken. They have conceived that I have had ill Deſigns to the State, and to the Kingdom; Truly I look upon it as a Judgment, and a juſt Judgment of God, not but I have offended ſo much the State, and the Kingdom, and the Parliament, as that I have had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream vanity in ſerving them very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily. For thoſe Actions that I have done, I think it is known they have been ever very faithful to the Publick, and very particularly to Parliaments. My Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been ever expreſt truly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them. The diſpoſitions of Affairs now have put things in another poſture then they were when I was engaged with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have never gone off from thoſe Principles that ever I have profeſſed; I have lived in them, and by Gods Grace will die in them. There may be Alterations and Changes that may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them further then I thought reaſonable, and, truly there I left them: But there hath been nothing that I have ſaid, or done, or profeſſed, either by Covenant or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath not been very conſtant and very clear, upon the Principles that I ever have gone upon; which was to ſerve
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65909:120"/>the King, the Parliament, Religion (I ſhould have ſaid in the firſt place) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdom; That made me think it no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper time, being preſt out by Accidents and Circumſtances, to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdom, which I thought was proper, ſince there was ſomthing then in Agitation, but nothing agreed on, for ſending Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to the King, that was the furtheſt aim that I had, and truly beyond that I had no Intention, none at all. And God be praiſed, although my Bloud comes to be ſhed here, there was I think ſcarce a drop of Bloud ſhed in that Action that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. For the preſent Affairs as they are, I cannot tell how to judge of them; and truly they are in ſuch a condition, as (I conceive) no body can make a judgment of them; and therefore I muſt make uſe of Prayers, rather then of my Opinion; which are, That God would bleſs this Kingdom, this Nation, this State; that he would ſettle it in a way agreeable to what this Kingdom hath bin happily governed under; by a King, by the Lords, by the Commons; a Government that I conceive it hath flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed much under, and I pray God the change of it bring not rather a Prejudice, a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65909:121"/>diſorder, and a confuſion, then the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I look upon the Poſterity of the King, and truly my Conſcience directs me to it, to deſire, that if God be pleaſed, that theſe people may look upon them with that Affection that they owe, that they may be called in again, and they may be, not through bloud, nor through diſorder, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again into that power, and to that glory, that God in their birth intended to them. I ſhall pray with all my ſoul for the happineſs of this State, of this Nation, that the Bloud which is here ſpilt, may even be the laſt that may fall among us; and truly I ſhould lay down my Life with as much Chearfulneſs as ever perſon did, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that there would be no more Bloud follow us; for a State or Affairs that are built upon Bloud, is a Foundation for the moſt part that doth not proſper.</p>
               <p>After the Bleſſing that I give to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Kingdom, and truly to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, I do wiſh with all my heart, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and a bleſſing to all thoſe that have been Authors in this buſineſs; and truly, that have been Authors in this very work that bringeth us hither: I do not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, but I pray heartily and really for them, as God will forgive my ſins, ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God may forgive them.</p>

               <p> I have a particular Relation, as I am Chancellor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and truly I muſt here, ſince it is the laſt of my Prayers, pray to God that that Univerſity may go on in that happy way which it is in, that God may make it a Nurſery to plant thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may be diſtributed to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the ſouls of the people may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a great benefit, and a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by them, and (I hope) God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for their kindneſs, and their affections that I have found from them
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mr.</hi> Bolton.</note> I have ſaid what Religion I have been bred in, what Religion I have been born in, what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion I have practiſed, I began with it, and I muſt end with it. I told you that my Actions &amp; my Life have not been agreeable to my Breeding. I have told you likewiſe that the Family where I was bred, hath been an exemplary Family (I may ſay ſo, I hope, without Vanity) of much affection to Religion, and of much faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to this Kingdom, and to this State, I have endeavoured to do thoſe Actions that became an honeſt man, and a good <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and which became a good Chriſtian. I have been willing to oblige thoſe that have been in trouble, thoſe that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65909:122"/>have been in Perſecution, and truly I find a great Reward of it; for I have found their Prayers and their kindneſs now in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and in this condition, and I think it a great reward, and I pray God reward them for it.</p>
               <p>I am a great ſinner, and I hope God will be pleaſed to hear my prayers, to give me faith to truſt in him, that as he hath called me to death at this place, he will make it but a paſſage to an eternal Life through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, which I truſt to, which I rely upon, and which I expect by the Mercy of God. And ſo I pray God bleſs you all, and ſend that you may ſee this to be the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and the laſt bloud that is likely to be ſpilt among you. And then turning to the ſide-rayl, he prayed for a good ſpace of time; after which, Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord, now look upon him whom you have truſted. My Lord, I hope that here is your laſt Prayer, there will no more Prayers remain, but Praiſes; and I hope that after this day is over, there will a day begin that ſhall never have end; and I look upon this (my Lord) the Morning of it, the Morning of that day. My Lord, You know where your Fulneſs lies, where your riches lie, where is your only Rock to anchor on; you know there
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65909:122"/>is fulneſs in Chriſt: If the Lord comes not in with fulneſs of Comfort to you, yet reſolve to wait upon him while you live, and to truſt in him when you die; and then ſay, I will die here, I will periſh at thy feet, I will be found dead at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt. Certainly, he that came to ſeek and ſave loſt ſinners, will not reject loſt ſinners when they come to ſeek him; He that intreateth us to come, will not ſleight us when we come to intreat him. My Lord, there is enough there, and fix your heart there, and fix your eyes there, that eye of Faith, and that eye of Hope; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe theſe Grace; now, there will be no exerciſe hereafter. As your Lordſhip ſaid, here take an end of Faith, and take an end of Hope, and take a Farewel of Repentance, and all theſe; and welcome God, and welcome Chriſt, and welcome Glory, and welcome Happineſs to all Eternity; and ſo it will be an happy paſsage then, if it be a paſſage here from miſery to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And though it be but a ſad way, yet, if it will bring you into the preſence of Joy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a Valley of Tears, although it be a ſhadow of death, yet if God will pleaſe to bring you, and make it a paſſage to that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, welcome Lord. And I doubt not, but God will give you an heart to taſt ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love in this bitter Potion, and to ſee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65909:123"/>ſomthing of Mercy and Goodneſs to you, and ſhew you ſome ſign and token of good, ſo that your ſoul may ſee that which we have had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready experience of (bleſſed be God for it) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Experiences, many Expreſſions, not only in words, nor tears; God hath not left us without much Comfort and evidence, and I hope</hi> (my Lord) <hi>you that have given ſo many Evidences to us, I hope you want none your ſelf, but that the Lord will be pleaſed to ſupport you, and bear up your Spirit, and if there want Evidence, there is Reliance, my ſecurity lies not in my knowing that I ſhall come to Heaven, and come to Glory, but in my reſting and relying upon him; when the Anchor of Faith is thrown out, there may be ſhakings and toſſings, but there is Safety; nothing ſhall interrupt Safety, although ſomthing may interrupt Security: my ſafety is ſure, although I apprehend it not: and what if I go to God in the dark? What if I come to him, as</hi> Nicodemus <hi>did, ſtaggering in the night? It is a night of trouble, a night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though I come trembling and ſtaggering in this night, yet I ſhall be ſure to find comfort and fixedneſs in him. And the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be the ſtrength, ſtay and ſupport of your ſoul, and the Lord furniſh you with all thoſe Graces which may carry you into the beſom of the Lord Jeſus, that when you expire this life,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65909:123"/>you may be able to expire it into him, in whom you may begin to live to all Eternity; and that is my humble Prayer.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Holland.</hi> M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> God hath given me long time in this world; he hath carried me through many great accidents of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he hath at laſt brought me down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition, where I find my ſelf brought to an end, for a diſ-affection to this State, to this Parliament, that (as I ſaid before) I did believe no body in the world more unlikely to have expected to ſuffer for that cauſe; I look upon it as a great Judgment of God for my ſins. And truly, Sir, ſince that the death is violent, I am the leſs troubled with it, becauſe of thoſe violent deaths that I have ſeen before; principally my Saviour, that hath ſhewed us the way, how, and in what manner he hath done it, and for what cauſe, I am the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, I am the more rejoyced. It is not long ſince the King my Maſter paſſed in the ſame man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er; and truly I hope that his purpoſes and intentions were ſuch, as a man may not be aſhamed, not only to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in the way that was taken with him, but likewiſe not aſhamed of his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, if God had given him life. I have often diſputed with him concerning many
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65909:124"/>things of this kind, and I conceive his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and his better knowledge, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding (if God had ſpared him life) might have made him a Pr. very happy toward himſelf &amp; this Kingdom. I have ſeen and known that thoſe bleſſed ſouls in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have paſſed thither by the gate of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and many by the gate of violence; and ſince it is Gods pleaſure to diſpoſe me this way, I ſubmit my ſoul to him, with all comfort, and with all hope, that he hath made this my end, and this my concluſion, that though I be low in death, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this lowneſs ſhall raiſe me to the higheſt glory for ever.</p>
               <p>Truly, I have non ſaid much in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to the People, concerning the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Actions that I conceive I have done by my Counſels in this Kingdom, I conceive they are well known, it were ſomthing of vanity (methinks) to take notice of them here: I'le rather die with them, with the comfort of them in my own boſom, &amp; that I never intended in this Action, or any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ever I did in my life, either malice, or bloudſhed, or prejudice to any creature that lives. For that which concerns my Religion, I made my Profeſſion before of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65909:126"/>was done in the world, was the bloud of Chriſt that was ſhed, never any thing like it: And this Bloud of Chriſt that was ſhed, was ſhed for them that come, if not for them, for none, it was in vain elſe: You ſee the Devils they are out of capacity of good by it, the Angels they have no need of it, wicked men will not come, and there are but few that come over, but a few that come over, and ſhould he deny them, there were no end nor fruit of the Blond and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord Jeſus: and had your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip been with Chriſt in that bloudy Agony, when he was in that bloudy ſweat, ſweating drops of Bloud, if you had asked him, Lord, what art thou now a doing, art thou not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling an angry God and me together, art thou not pacifying the wrath of God? art thou not interpoſing thy ſelf between the Juſtice of God and my ſoul?

            <p>Not to ſummon the Genius of that place to an account, we will derive the cruelty of thoſe ſanguinary perpetrations upon the lives of theſe men from asſtrange and hidden Notions.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65909:133"/>his helping hand to the reſtoring of the King; and this being an Important Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, making the Royal Intereſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the North, much care was taken by the well-affected people adjacent thereto for a ſupply of that place with all manner of proviſion of Arms and ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>The care whereof Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intely took upon himſelf, and before any formal ſiege, the Parliament-Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe employed, had ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes thereto, maintained a ſtrict intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, was often out upon Parties with them, and had regulated and ſtated the Contribution from the places therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, which was either freely paid, or as couragiouſly forced, till after the defeat of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> they were wholly ſurrounded, and block'd up.</p>
            <p>This diſtreſs of his Friends further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to their aſſiſtance, ſo far was the danger from detering of him, therefore he adventured in his own perſon to go and ſee in what condition they were, and to take a view of the likelieſt means of relief, and give an account of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſtrength, and advantages, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65909:133"/>and moſt attemptible place of their Lines and entrenchment.</p>
            <p>But in this deſign he was ſurprized and taken, and immediately brought before a Council of War, who enraged at the death of <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> and inſolenced by their late many Victories, &amp; Fleſh'd with the carnage and blood of ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Sacrifices, eſpecially that of the King's, they made no bones of him, but condemned him to the Gibbet with ſuch fury and haſt, that they would ſcarce afford him time to recommend himſelf from their mercileſs Bar to the merciful and juſt Tribunal of Heaven, which would ere long judge righteouſly in his cauſe between his Enemies and himſelf.</p>
            <p>He was not long in preparation for his diſſolution, having as well learned as taught the neceſſity of Death; improved to him into an eaſie ſuffering, &amp; undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by the glory of his cauſe, ſo that he quietly ſubmitted to their Sentence; and with Chriſtian reſolution, owning his actions in order to his duty, laid down his life the day and year aforeſaid, and will therefore deſervedly among the reſt of his glorious Company be had in precious and everlaſting remembrance.</p>
            <pb n="246" facs="tcp:65909:134"/>
            <p> Not long afterwards followed the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Pontefract</hi>-Caſtle, ſurprized as aforeſaid by Col. <hi>Morris;</hi> they had ſtood it out to extremity, there being no place in <hi>England</hi> for the King beſides, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were forced to accept of very hard Conditions: which were, that ſix of the gariſon, whom they ſhould chuſe, ſhould be left at diſcretion.

            <p>Among thoſe, or rather for thoſe this Gentleman was taken, being the Governor of the place, and with Cornet <hi>Michael Blackbourn,</hi> and the others brought to the City of <hi>York,</hi> and committed to that Goal until the Summer-Aſſizes held there by Baron <hi>Thorp</hi> for that County, when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment of Treaſon was brought againſt them for levying War againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; &amp; therupon found guilty by a pack'd Jury and after Sentence of being hanged, drawn, and quartered, they were executed the day and year aforeſaid, the rigour of diſmembring them being only abated.

               <p>Theſe pains are nothing, if compared to thoſe dolors and pains, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Saviour hath ſuffered for us; when in a bloody-Sweat he endured the Wrath of God, the pain of Hell, and the curſed and ſhameful death which was due to our ſins; therefore I praiſe the Lord that I am not plagued with far more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous puniſhment, that the like hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen others, who undoubtedly are moſt glorious and bleſſed Saints with Chriſt in Heaven. It is the Lords affliction, and who will not take any affliction in good part when it comes from the hand of God? And what? ſhall we receive good from the hands of God, and not receive evil? And though I deſire, as I am carnal, that this Cup may depart from me, yet not

               </p>
               <p>Therefore bleſſed are they that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of ſo vile a world, and freed from ſuch a body of bondage and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſoul ſhall enjoy immediate Communion with God in evetlaſting bliſs and glory; it takes us from the miſeries of this world, and ſociety of ſinners, to the City of the living God, the celeſtial <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

            <p>THis learned Gentleman was deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of an antient family in <hi>Oxford</hi>-ſhire, whoſe chief ſeat and reſidence was near <hi>Botley,</hi> within a mile of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. His education was truly generous, his profeſſion the Civil Law, wherein he was graduated a Doctor, and in which he was excellently known before theſe Wars.</p>
            <p>But when theſe uncivil broils began, he laid aſide the practice of that Law, which was not onely ſilenced, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and annihilation of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, in whoſe Courts it is moſt general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, but alſo deſpair'd of for any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſuſcitation during the Troubles; and he took himſelf to the ſervice of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, then moſt <hi>unlawfully</hi> and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy aſſaulted and affronted by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65909:138"/>of the Parliament, where he had the ſame terms, and was concluded in the Articles of that Capitulation; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to accept, and lay down his arms, he again reſumed his wonted ſtudies.</p>
            <p>From theſe he was again avocated by thoſe monſtrous and horrid actions of thoſe times, which indulged not any man his private concerns in the danger and trouble of the publick, nor could he forſake, or deſert his firſt cauſe with its fortune, and ſerve the times by a baſe and abject indifferency.</p>
            <p>He had to the infinite diſtraction of his mind, and trouble of his ſoul, ſeen the barbarous Regicide perpetrated upon the life of his Sovereign; the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily renounced and baniſhed, all the friends thereof in moſt eminent danger to be deſtroyed, and undone for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, and the Laws in the late War, the Church and State renverſed, and a ſad confuſion and ruine of the Kingdom (unleſs obviated by Providence, and means therewith uſed) to be impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe and the like conſiderations, this Gentleman, very conſiderable in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65909:139"/>his numerous acquaintance, prudence and integrity, became engaged for the Son our preſent Sovereign, as before for his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father; ſeveral conſultations, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings were held by him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in order to this ſervice, to which purpoſe he alſo received Commiſſions from the King, then in <hi>France,</hi> for ſeveral Officers of theſe Forces deſigned to be raiſed, and other Inſtructions, as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair proceeded.</p>
            <p>The Common-wealth, as it was then called, was in its infancy, which made its politick Guardians very cautious, and jealous of attempts upon it; the Kings intereſt was no whit the leſs formidable, becauſe his perſon was beyond the Sea, the juſt indignation, and noble anger of his Subjects being ready to boil over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſudden motion; they had alſo ſo oppreſſed the generality of the people with grievous &amp; inſupportable Taxes, that they might well fear and ſuſpect ſome more forcible and proſperous enterpriſe againſt them, by how much their imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and high provocations had further incenſed both heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>Therefore they employed their Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Spies to give them intelligence,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65909:139"/>if any ſuch deſigns were on foot, and ſo to countermine all plots againſt them. Their ſagacious induſtry in this ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their expectation: for theſe flies prying up and down, engaging in all companies, aſſimulating themſelves to their complexion, opinion, and ſtudy, light at laſt upon ſome glimpſes of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they followed ſo cloſe, that at laſt they made a perfect and full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the main buſineſſe, and that this Doctor <hi>Levens</hi> was the chief Agitator and manager thereof, in whoſe breaſt the <hi>Cabal</hi> was principally lodged and entruſted, and upon whoſe apprehenſion they might be informed and ſatisfied in every circumſtance.</p>
            <p>An Order was thereupon made by the Council of State, and a Warrant ſigned by <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Preſident to ſeize, and bring him before them, and to ſearch his Chamber, and break up his Trunks for papers, he then being at <hi>London,</hi> the place moſt expedient for the deſign, which accordingly was done, a file or two of Musketeers guarding, and ſecuring the houſe, where the ſaid Papers were, among which there were blank Commiſſions ſigned by the King to the purport afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65909:140"/>were found with him, and carried to the Council, who thereupon ordered him to be proceeded againſt as a ſpie, and referred him to a Council of War.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he was ſoon afterwards tried by a Court Martial, where he did not excuſe himſelf, or extenuate his fault, but very modeſtly &amp; handſomly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their allegations againſt him, and the juſtice of his cauſe, of which he told them he was no way aſhamed, but, if it muſt be ſo, would willingly lay down his life in the owning of it. He told them moreover, that he was bound indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the Laws of God and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to do what he did, and ſo referred himſelf to them. They very earneſtly preſſed him to reveal the other parties engaged with him, and gave him ſome fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious hopes of life, if he would freely declare them, but thoſe offers prevailed not with him, being reſolved to ſuffer and take all upon himſelf, rather then to ruine others, whom they could not faſten upon without his diſcovery.</p>
            <p>So the Court proceeded to Sentence, which was, that he ſhould be hanged o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt the <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:65909:140"/>in <hi>Exchange</hi> time, which after ſome little preparation was executed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in a Coach from the <hi>Mews,</hi> with the Executioner vizarded with him, and a Troop of Horſe to guard him to the ſaid place, where the Sheriffs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into their charge. After he alighted, and ſome words paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them concerning the ſaid diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, he told them they ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, and deſired them to forbear any further trouble to that purpoſe, and ſo aſcended that ladder, which reached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, wherein he prayed very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently for the King, and the Church, and commended his ſoul into the hands of the Redeemer, and ſo concluded his laſt breath, which at the falling of his body mounted his ſoul to heaven, in whoſe bliſsful manſions he nows ſings <hi>Hallelujah</hi> for ever.</p>

Which conſidered, and that Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> Baroner, Major <hi>Bernard,</hi> Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> Captain <hi>Benſon,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Aſhley</hi> (with whom he had the laſt and moſt queſtionable correſpondency) were all in cuſtody; he found himſelf to be betrayed, but could not at preſent gueſſe by whom: but well ſaw, that he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be fair in his Confeſſion, then to deny what he ſaw by the perfectneſs of his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners would be proved againſt him by the diſcovery of thoſe formerly ſecured, and examined before his coming up, and ſo reſolved to bear the worſt, and not ſo much to ſhame himſelf, or the matter, as to deny things evident, or eaſily prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but rather to caſt himſelf upon God; and come off as well as he could with a truth in his mouth.</p>
            <p>In his Anſwers he would have been circumſtantial, but was kept cloſe to the Queſtion, At his departure he deſired he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65909:142"/>might ſet down his own Narrative accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own ſenſe, which was granted him to prepare, and to ſend, or bring them as there was opportunity. And, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving totally, and as much as in him lay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his fellow-priſoners as to any thing related to his Delinquency, he was with them committed to the Gate-houſe.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday following he was re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and re-examined; and on Friday again convented, and delivered in his Narrative to the Lord Preſident, and by him without further words returned. On Saturday he was re-called, and then as at all times before uſed and treated with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, being only much preſſed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome great Perſons his ſuppoſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; their aym being, as he ſuppoſed, at Sir <hi>Guy Palms,</hi> Sir <hi>John Curſon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Whitmore,</hi> &amp;c. But it was a great bleſſing in his unhappineſs, that it was not cumulative, nor fatal to any of his friends and familiars, who yet knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the reaſon of his impriſonment, more then by common ſame.</p>
            <p>On Sunday next he was called out of his bed, and by two Meſſengers, his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and his man, brought into a Boat at <hi>Kings</hi>-bridge <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65909:142"/>to the Tower, The Warrant which was read at the Lieutenants houſe, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That he was committed cloſe priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for high Treaſon, in endeavouring to ſubvert the preſent Government, to be kept till delivered by Law.</p>
            <p>He was deſigned for a Priſon-lodging by Col. <hi>Weſt</hi> the Lieutenant; but upon notice of his quality he was put into the cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Slaidon,</hi> one of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his houſe, equally convenient with the beſt. At his firſt coming to the Tower he had but two ſhillings in his Purſe, and ſuppoſing he ſhould be provided for at the States-charges, he ſent to the Lieutenant to know what he would order for him; who returned, that if he had money he might have what he would, but at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion nothing.</p>
            <p>His keeper was upon his delivery to his charge commanded to keep him ſafe, and if he eſcap'd threatned to be hanged, and a Sentinel ſet immediately at his door; and that day two Gentlewomen, coming to ſee him, were all impriſoned in the Round-houſe, and next day carried to the Council of State, and ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>His Waterman that week brought him
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65909:143"/>ſome money, for which, and ſome affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate words ſpoken of him, he was brought before the Preſident, examined, rebuked, and diſmiſſed, and a Centinel ſet at Mr. <hi>Andrew's</hi> window that he might not ſpeak to any without.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Caſe was this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Engagement for his late Majeſty began in 1642. and continued until the ſurrender of <hi>Worceſter</hi> 1645. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded not for his Delinquency, not having a conſiderable, and not willing to own an inconſiderable Eſtate. He took neither Proteſtation, Solemn League and Covenant, Negative Oath, nor ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Engagement.</p>
            <p>At his return to <hi>London</hi> to a private practice in his Calling for his neceſſary ſupport; <hi>John Bernard,</hi> ſometimes a Major under him, by reaſon of his good parts, and ſober demeanor, being in his good opinion frequently viſited him, and imparted to him ſuch Occurrences, as he met abroad in diſcourſe, and did intimate the diſcontents of the Levellers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitators, and the proceedings of a certain Committee of Officers, to which he was
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65909:143"/>Clerk, upon a printed charge againſt ſome of the Parliament for oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By ſuch diſcoveries he at laſt obtruded on the Colonel the acquaintance of one Capt. <hi>Helmes,</hi> who ſoon after brought with him one <hi>Benſon,</hi> who pretended to have ſerved under Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produced Letters, tranſcripts of Letters (with the copying, whereof he pretended to be intruſted by Mr. <hi>Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>) which appeared to purport mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, to be delivered to Mr. <hi>Buſhel</hi> to be ſent beyond-Sea.</p>
            <p>Theſe two inſinuated what intereſt they had in the Reformadoes, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage would be done by them for the Royal Party, and magnified Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> intereſt in his Country; and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and reluctancie for what he had done for the Parliament. <hi>Barnard</hi> then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded that a deſign formerly in the War laid by him for the taking of the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> might by the ſaid asſiſtance, and Sir <hi>John's</hi> aid be revived and executed, but this project failed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> 1649. <hi>Helmes</hi> brought the Col. inſtructions to draw up a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> for his Arreares: this procured a meeting, where Sir <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:65909:144"/>took notice of his ill requital for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and deſired to be repreſented to his new Majeſty as his Loyal Subject for the future, and no more paſſed.</p>
            <p>There coming out ſoon after an Act, commanding Cavaliers to depart the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> being in treaty about tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanting himſelf into Sir <hi>Edward Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> Plantation in New-<hi>Album;</hi> He was again viſited by Major <hi>Barnard</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who gave him notice of a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſign laid, ond friends and mony to back it; and that he ſhould have 200 pound, and power to draw more by bills of Exchange, if I would go over and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſaid deſign with the Prince, and then in general terms acquainted him that it was an eaſie matter, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers going out of Town, by correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all Counties, to ſurprize uhe Horſe of the Army in their ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the Col. anſwer was, that if the mony were ready, he would entertain the motion.</p>
            <p>Next day after they came again, and told him that the Gentlemen of <hi>Kent, Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> would preſently be near the Town, and would joyn in an Engagement, and raiſe mony; that Sir
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65909:144"/>
               <hi>John Gell</hi> would engage likewiſe, and might eaſily bring in his Friends Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Knevela,</hi> Sir <hi>Guy Palmes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fieq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore deſired the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel to draw an Engagement (which he did in a looſe Paper, according to the ſenſe they inſtructed him) and to move Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> in the buſineſs, but preſſed not the Coll. then to joyn in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he ſpoke with Sir <hi>John,</hi> who refuſed to joyn, or meddle in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, not daring to truſt <hi>Benſon,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his deſire to the Col. if he went over to poſſeſs the King with a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65909:145"/>Horſe, while the other two preſſed him again to get Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> to ſeal an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement which <hi>Benſon</hi> had engroſſed; which he refuſed, and told them, he was able to ſatisfie any body of Sir <hi>John Gel's</hi> reality, though not actually engaged.

My Lord, I am at an unuſual Bar, engaged in a great Cauſe of a far, and extendible Concernment; my fee is life, and my dutie is ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which in it ſelf were leſs conſiderable, if by a preſident of my ſuffering, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence would not prove miſchievouſly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical.</hi>

                     <hi>I do not refuſe to plead to the Charge, but humbly crave leave to offer my Reaſons for the ſuſpending of my Plea.

                  <p>He proceeded with admirable Elegance and ſtrength of Argument, and Reaſon throughout his Tryal: But that bloody <hi>Court,</hi> and cruel <hi>Attourney Gen. Prideaux</hi> over-ruled them all: telling him, that the <hi>Court</hi> was not at leiſure to take notice of thoſe <hi>Law-Caſes,</hi> but of his Confeſſion; that he had an affection to it though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acted, and that was ſufficient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and for that affection he deſerved Death; and thereupon the <hi>Court</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence againſt him, that he ſhould be beheaded. Thus was the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of a Freeman of <hi>England</hi> denyed by wicked Murtherers, whoſe will was their only Law.</p>
                  <p>Between Sentence and Execution he received a preparatory Letter to Death from a Dear friend, to which he returned this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Friend, Your words ſent to me were ſuch, and ſo ſeaſonable, that I have given them the ſame entertainment, as becomes
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65909:149"/>me to afford to Apples of Gold, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of ſilver; and if I be after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation diſſected, you may finde them in my heart, where you always have had a Manſion.</p>
                  <p>If fear were abſolutely a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſion by which to denote a man, I muſt as yet be accounted among ſome other Species of Animality. <hi>The fear of</hi> Iſaac <hi>hath baniſh'd all other dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> I look upon Death as upon that Rod in the hand of God, with which he would not have corrected me if leſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection would have ſerv'd turn; and which he doth now exerciſe upon me, becauſe he is reſolved not to let me be leſs then a Son beloved; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bear the ſtripes, and kiſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. I am ſorry that my Rod is bound together with the ſin of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer, and wiſh him Repentance, that when the Rod comes to be burned, he ſuffer not in the flame.</p>
                  <p>I am proud, and covetous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from the double impriſonment I lie under, of the fleſh and bones, and am ready for the opportunity to make an
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65909:150"/>eſcape, though in a fiery Chariot. All things betwixt God and me are removed from my ſight; and I ſee him clearly without reflexion on my Judges, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers: and ſubmit chearfully to His fatherly Diſpenſation, and Judgement.</p>
                  <p>My Judges have done me no wrong; they have a Law for their Warrant, and my confeſſion for their Evidence; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have capacity to be <hi>Chancellors</hi> in matters of life; Let them go free, and the Law-makers? and inforcers of it, for their errours in conſtituting them, before the padling in blood grow too cuſtomary to be thought a ſin worthy their confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſorrow, which I deſire for the fakes of their ſouls, and the lives of the oppreſſed, and in indeed preſcribed Free <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi>

            <p> ABout the ſame time he made his Will, a taſte whereof take in theſe few following lines. — <hi>If it be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable and uncontrolable Will of God, that I</hi> Euſebius Andrews, <hi>Eſq ſhall for my manifold and high Provocations of his Divine Majeſty be ſhipwrackt by that ſtorme which impendeth over my head, I moſt humbly and chearfully ſubmit unto ſuch his good will and pleaſure, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and deſire, that my body may be privately interred in the Pariſh Church of</hi> Alhallows Bark. <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>as near as may be to the Reverend Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>there with him to expect a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſurrection. I beſeech God to bleſs my daughter</hi> Mavilda Andrews, <hi>and to ſupply to her, what by my improvidence, and the accidents of the late tempeſtuous times, as in my being taken away became deficient; and that he would preſerve her from want and diſhonour, and from being by any evil Counſel, or example, led aſide into the foul errors of this Nation in matters concerning her ſouls health,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here he gave her, and the whole world, an account of his faith, which was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant from Popery, Presbytery, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65909:151"/>Independency, all which he charactered, profeſſing himſelf a true ſon of this Church, as governed by Epiſcopacy, and conluded thus; <hi>I deſire ſuch, who approve my profeſſion, to cover my faults in their charity, and to let me be ſweet in their memory. As for the reſt, I wiſh them a ſeaſonable repentance, but ſet no price either upon their opinion or report, Vivat Rex, currat Lex, floreat Grex; fiat voluntas Des modo in mina mea.</hi>

                  <hi>The Speech of Col.</hi> Euſebius Andrews <hi>immediately before his Execution on the Scaffold on</hi> Tower-hill, <hi>on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Auguſt 22. 1650. <hi>being attended on by Dr.</hi> Swadling.</head>
               <p>AS ſoon as he came upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, kiſſing the block, he ſaid, I hope there is no more but this block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and heaven; and to the <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> he ſaid, I hope I ſhall neither tire in my way, nor go out of it. After he had been a good while upon the Scaffold, turning to the rail, he ſpeaks to the people as followeth; <hi>Chriſtian Gentlemen and people,</hi> Your buſineſs hither to day is to ſee a ſad ſpectacle, a man to be in a moment unman'd, and cut off in the prime of his years, taken from further opportunities of doing good either to himſelf, his friends, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> or eſpecially to God; it ſeldom happens but upon very good cauſe. And though truly, if my general known courſe of life were but inquired into, I may modeſtly ſay there is ſuch a moral of honeſty upon it, as ſome may be ſo ſawcy as to expoſtulate why this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65909:152"/>great judgment is fallen upon me; but know, I am able to give them and my ſelf an anſwer, and out of this breaſt am able to give a better account of my Judgment and Execution then my <hi>Judges</hi> themſelves, or you are able to give; It is Gods wrath upon me for ſins long unrepented of, many Judgements with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and mercies ſlighted; therefore God hath whipped me by his ſevere rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that he might not loſe me: I pray joyn with me in prayer, that it may not be a fruitleſs rod, that when by this rod I have laid down my life, by this ſtaffe I may be comforted, and received into glory. I am very confident by what I have heard ſince my ſentence, there is more exception made againſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt me then I even made. My tryers had a Law, and the value of that Law is indiſputable, and for me to make a queſtion of it, I ſhould ſhame my ſelf and my diſcretion. In the ſtrictneſs of that Law ſomething is done by me, that is applicable to ſome clauſe therein, by which I ſtand condemnable: the means whereby I was brought under that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of that which was in my ſelf intended maliciouſly, being teſtimony
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65909:152"/>given (by perſons whom I pity) ſo falſe, yet ſo poſitive, that I cannot condemn my <hi>Judges</hi> for paſſing ſentence againſt me, according to legal Juſtice; for equity lieth in higher breaſts.</p>
               <p>As for my Accuſers, or rather betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I pity, and am ſorry for them, they have committed <hi>Judas</hi> his crime, but I wiſh and pray for them <hi>Peters tears,</hi> that by <hi>Peters</hi> repentance they may eſcape <hi>Judas</hi> his puniſhment; and I wiſh other people ſo happy, they may be taken up betimes before they have drunk up more blood of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> men, poſſibly leſs deſerving then my ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is true, there have been ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes made for mercy, and I will put the obſtruction of it upon nothing more then upon my own ſin, and ſeeing God ſees it fit, (having not glorified him in my life) I might do it in my death; which I am contented to do. I profeſs in the face of God, particular malice to any one of State or Parliament, to do them a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in jury I had none.</p>
               <p>For the Cauſe in which I had long wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I muſt needs ſay, my engagement or continuance in it hath laid no ſcruple
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65909:153"/>upon my Conſcience, it was in principles of Law; the knowledge whereof I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and on principles of <hi>Religion,</hi> my <hi>Judgement</hi> ſatisfied, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, that I have purſued thoſe ways which I bleſs God I find no blackneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Conſcience, nor have I put it into the bed-roll of my ſins.</p>
               <p>I will not preſume to decide contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies; I deſire God to honour himſelf in proſpering that ſide that hath right with it, and that you may enjoy peace and plenty; when I ſhall enjoy peace and plenty, beyond all you poſſeſſe here; in my converſation in the world, I do not know where I have an enemy with cauſe, or that there is ſuch a perſon whom I have to regret; but if there be any whom I cannot recollect under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> men, I pardon them, as freely as if I had named them by name, I freely forgive them, being in free peace with all the world, as I deſire God for Chriſts ſake, to be at peace with me. For the buſineſs of death, it is a ſad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in it ſelf, if men conſult with fleſh and blood: But truly without boaſting, I ſay it, or if I do boaſt, I boaſt in the Lord, I have not to this minute, had one
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65909:153"/>conſultation with the fleſh about the blow of the <hi>Axe,</hi> or one thought of the <hi>Axe,</hi> more then as my paſs-port to glory.</p>
               <p>I take it for an honour, and I owe thankfulneſs to thoſe under whoſe power I am, that they have ſent me hither to a place, however of puniſhment, yet of ſome honour to die a death, ſomewhat worthy of my blood, anſwerable to my birth and qualification, and this courteſie of theirs hath much helped towards the pacification of my mind.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deſire God that thoſe <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in that ſad bed-rol to be tried by the High Court of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that they may find that really there than is nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Act; an High Court of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> a Court of high <hi>Juſtice,</hi> high in its righteouſneſs, though not in its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Father forgive them, and forgive me as I forgive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire you now that you would pray for me, and not give over praying till the hour of death, not till the moment of death, for the hour is come already; that as I have a great load of ſins, ſo I may have the wings of your prayers, to help thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> that are to convey
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65909:154"/>my ſoul to Heaven, and I doubt not, but I ſhall ſee my Saviour, my gallant Maſter the King of <hi>England,</hi> and another Maſter whom I much honoured; my Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> hoping this day to ſee my <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in the preſence of him, my Lord <hi>Capel</hi> in the preſence of them all, and my ſelf there to rejoyce with all other <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

               <p>One thing more I deſire to be clear in. There lieth a common imputation upon the Cavaliers, that they are Papiſts; and under that Name we are made odious to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65909:156"/>thoſe of the contrary opinion: I am not a Papiſt, but renounce the <hi>Pope</hi> with all his dependencies? when the diſtractions in <hi>RELIGION</hi> firſt ſprang up, I might have been thought apt to turn from this <hi>Church</hi> to the <hi>Roman,</hi> but was utterly unſatisfied in their Doctrine, in point of Faith, and very much as to their Diſcipline. The <hi>Religion</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is that which paſſeth under the name of <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> though that be rather a name of diſtinction, then properly eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to <hi>Religion.</hi> But the <hi>Religion</hi> which was found out in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> purged from all the errours of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, practiſed in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> that bleſſed Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; that <hi>Religion</hi> before it was defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I am of, which I take to be <hi>Chriſts Catholique,</hi> though not the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion:</hi> in the profeſſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereof, I will live and die; that for my <hi>Religion.</hi> Then he turnd himſelf unto the Executioner; I have no reaſon to quarrel with thee; thou art not the hand that throws the ſtone; I am not of ſuch an Eſtate to be liberal, but there is three pound for thee, which is all I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65909:157"/>have. Now tell me what I lack? Execut. <hi>Your hair's to be turned up.</hi> Col. <hi>Shew me how to fit my ſelf upon the block. After which his doublet being off, and hair turned up, he turned again to the people, and prayed a good while: Before he laid down upon the Block, he ſpake again to the people,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>There is not one face that looks upon me, though many faces, and perhaps dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from me in opinion and practice, but (methinks) hath ſomething of pity in it; and, may that mercy which is in your hearts fall into your own boſomes, when you have need of it; and may you never find ſuch blocks of ſin to ſtand in the way of your mercy, as I have met with. I beſeech you joyn with me in prayer. Then he prayed (leaning on the Scaffold) with an audible Voyce for about a quarter of an hour; having done, he had ſome private conference with Doctor <hi>Swadling;</hi> Then taking his leave of his Friends, Sheriffs, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ſaluting them all with a courteous valediction, he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Block, kneeling down, ſaid, let me try the Block, which he did; after caſting his eyes up, and fixed them very intentively upon Heaven;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65909:157"/>he ſaid, when I ſay, <hi>Lord Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me,</hi> Executioner do thine Office; then kiſſing the Ax he laid down, and with as much undaunted, yet <hi>Chriſtian</hi> courage, as poſſible as could be in man, did he expoſe his throat to the fatal Ax. his life to the Executioner, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Soul into the Hands of a faithful and merciful Creator, through the meritorious paſſion of a gracious Redeemer: ſaying the forementioned words, his head was ſmitten off at one blow.</p>

            <p>AFter this Rebellion had aſſumed its various ſhapes, put all by, and made up with its ſeveral intereſts, till it had quite outed the manner of true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> when there was no Law left but the arbitrary Will and Powers of the <hi>Grandees</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> no man can wonder at this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Example in the ſad fate of this Honourable Perſon.</p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:65909:158"/>
            <p> The truth is, he was the noble Brother to that excellently prudent <hi>States-man,</hi> the Right Honourable Earl of <hi>Clarendel,</hi> Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from this <hi>Martyrs</hi> merit, if we involve it in his Brothers, whoſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence upon the Councels and affairs of this Nation, hath reſcued all honeſt and loyal men from the brinks of miſery and ruin ten thouſand times worſe then Death.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad Subject to Comment on, eſpecially becauſe we may repeat nothing here, but what has been moſt favourably, and that at his honourable Relations im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity quite forgiven, though I hope that pardon extends not beyond the Memory of the <hi>ſufferer,</hi> whatever it reaches to in the Oblivion of the <hi>Actor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was ſent, as he avowedly declared at his death as a Meſſenger only from our Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, ſoon after the murther of his Royal Father to the Grand Seignior; that Office he aptly himſelf termed an <hi>Internuncio,</hi> which to his and the Kindomes Enemies ſounded worſe then the jealouſie of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:65909:158"/>
            <p> I make uſe of that term to diſcover the occaſion of this his fate; ſince it hath its diverſity of Names according to the cuſtomes and Languages of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Envoy,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>French,</hi> but throughout the World barbarous or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, unleſſe by ſiniſter and bribed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the very name of ſuch perſons were feared, and had in publique Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>He was bred a Merchant, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Levant;</hi> and who by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had gained, not only a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eſtate therewith, but alſo a Repute and Eſtimation amongſt the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Company; who, conſidering him as an intelligent Perſon in the buſineſſe and management of that Traffique and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, made and conſtituted him their <hi>Conſul</hi> at the <hi>Morea;</hi> which place, with what integrity he diſcharged, and how diſcreetly and advantagiouſly for the benefit of the ſaid Company, he went through and performed, we need not offer to the Teſt, ſince ſo univerſally approved.</p>
            <p>For the convenience therefore of that concerning which the King had them at
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65909:159"/>the <hi>Port,</hi> this Gentleman was pitch upon and ſent thither, but what he would have tranſacted there, if not oppoſed, is not to be aſcertained; only thus far we may be aſſured, that there was little of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique matter therein, eſpecially of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to this Nation, or that Commerce in particular, as was moſt falſly and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly noiſed by his Enemies, as may appear by a little inſtance. For, near the ſame time, the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> being ſent Ambaſſadour from the King to the Emperour of <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> to acquaint him with the horrid mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Sovereign his Royal Father; and to deſire ſome aſſiſtance from him in order to the reducing of his Revolted Kingdomes; whereunto the Emperour frankly offered, beſides what he would diſburſe of his own, the whole Eſtates, Goods, Merchandizes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in his Dominions; my Lord ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed the motion, acquainting the Emperour, that the King never had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured any diſpleaſure againſt his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Subjects, of whoſe loyaltie and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him he was very well ſatisfied, though it was out of their power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſerve him.</p>
            <pb n="297" facs="tcp:65909:159"/>
            <p> So that it was a groundleſs and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable calumny framed on purpoſe to render him odious to the people: that his deſign and errand to <hi>Constantinople</hi> was upon the Merchants there in relation to their Eſtates, and that he was ſent in the room of Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> to be his Majeſties Leiger there for that purpoſe; a ſcandal which obliquely hit Sir <hi>Henry</hi> to the taking away his life, but was doubly aymed at his Majeſty, whom they would render to his Subjects (as they in their Traiterous Papers had called him) an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>London,</hi> and was preſently committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he paſt his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall omit any further account, but refer the Reader to that Apology or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh</hi> lately publiſhed, in excuſe of himſelf, and to free and clear his Reputation, charged with the guilt of this <hi>Martyrs</hi> death, and more eſpecially to what Sir <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf ſaid: a view whereof you have in the ſubſequent leaves.</p>
            <p>After ſome while impriſonment, he was brought before the <hi>High Court of Justice,</hi> and heard in defence of his life, wherein he would have uſed, and deſired to ſpeak in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, being through long diſuſe of his Mother-tongue not ſo ready and expreſſive, as that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter required he ſhould be; which requeſt, by the folly and madneſſe of his Judges was imputed to him as an affected pride and vanity. In concluſion, by a Power intruſted and lodged in that <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> by Authority of Parliament, he was ſentenced to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and the place and day aſſigned for the Execution.</p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:65909:160"/>
            <p> The main incentive to this villany was without doubt the nearneſſe of his Honourable Brother to the King, at whom this blow glanced; if alſo they did not remember and reckon their two preſumptuous Emiſſaries, and Agents, <hi>Doriſlaws</hi> and <hi>Achtan</hi> into the ſcore.</p>
            <p>However it was, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> nothing diſmaid at this outrage againſt his Life and Honour, quietly ſubmitted to his doom; and at his death, though accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied thereto with many diſeaſes and Infirmities, couragiouſly aſſerted his Cauſe, owned his Maſter the King; and cleared them both from any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions, and ſo rendered his Soul to God.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>H. Hide.</hi> Looking round on the People, he ſaid, A populous City, God bleſs it, and grant they may live to his Grace.

               </p>
               <p>Then ſtaying for his Servants, they being not on the Scaffold, he ſaid, I had rather have my Servants then ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>Then the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> coming to him, he ſaid, pray Sir rejoyce with me: I thank Almighty God I am brought hither to ſuffer for him.</p>

               <p>CHriſtian People, I come hither to die; I am brought hither to die; and that I may die Chriſtian-like, I humbly beſeech your Chriſtian Prayers, that by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65909:163"/>the benefit of them my paſſage may be the more eaſie: Yet becauſe men in that condition, which it hath pleaſed God to reduce me, carry more credit to their Speeches: In the diſcharge of my Duty towards God, I ſhall uſe a few words. and ſo diſpatch.</p>
               <p>I pray all of you joyn with me to praiſe this Almighty God, to whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to render all hearty thanks; as for all his mercies, ſo in particular for this, That he hath brought me hither: That whereas I owe a duty to Sin and to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I can pay it upon the account of Grace. And becauſe it is fit to render an account of the hope that is in me, I ſhall tell you, to the praiſe of Almighty God, That I have been born and bred up in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have no negative Religion, believing to be ſaved by the onely merits of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, (<hi>putting off his Hat</hi>) and whatſoever elſe is profeſt in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> authorized by Law, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching Almighty God to reſtore unto this Church her Peace, Proſperity and Patrimony, whereof I have been an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and a loving (however an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65909:163"/>Son. And now both my Hope being confident, and my Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, there remains onely Chriſtian Charity; Charity we carry into heaven, Charitie on Earth, and that I leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching all whomſoever I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (whether I have or no) to forgive me, as I from the bottom of my heart do them whomſoever; bleſſing Almighty God for the happy advantage he takes to bring me nearer to heaven; bleſſing Almighty God, that he hath given me this advantage, as he hath been merciful, to me before the foundation of the world in my Saviour; ſo that now he hath in mercy honoured me with ſuffering for his Name, in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>On this day ſeven night I was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before that Juſtice, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, praiſed be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that by this way he hath brought me the nearer to himſelf (<hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his hat</hi>) My Charge I preſume is publick, as my puniſhment is viſible: if there have been any thing in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of my part being unskilful, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcontinued my own Countrie many
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65909:164"/>years, I ſhall beſeech the Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all you my beloved Country-men, to impute it unto the right part, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in this skilful way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging: It was objected unto me there, that I had a vanitie of delighting in ſtrange Tongues. I was beſt skill'd in the <hi>Italian</hi> (but free from that vanity, I thank Almightie God) and therefore I would in defence of my life (if it had been the Cuſtom here, or the Judges favour) have uſed that Language.</p>
               <p>It was objected, That I did not ſo freely as a thorow-paced Cavalier, own my Maſter: I was told ſince I came into <hi>England</hi> (for other skill I have not in your Laws) that a legal Denial in Law might be tolerable; I hope I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the bounds of that in any thing, for God forbid that I ſhould be aſhamed of ſerving ſo good, ſo pious, ſo juſt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (<hi>putting off his hat</hi>) for that I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in rejoyce, and I humbly beſeech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God to fill my heart and my tongue, and all that hear me this day with thankfulneſs for it.</p>
               <p>As to the buſineſs, that another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction had been made and believed here, then what was there, the righteous
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65909:164"/>God knoweth it; if any weakneſs was in the management, that was mine: I was ſent to ſerve and protect, not to in jure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and as God acquits me of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in matter of Fact, as having done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of evil that way, however here underſtood, bleſſed be his holy Name, (<hi>putting off his hat</hi>) ſo thoſe Gentlemen of the Turkey Company, if they would ſeriouſly conſider, for they know it very well, the impoſſibilitie of my doing them any manner of harm. Whereas that of the Embaſſie objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, that my Maſter never honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with all, I was never worthy of it, I was his Meſſenger, an <hi>Internuncia</hi> for the conſervation only of his good Subjects, of all the Merchants, until ſuch time as he could confirm that Gentleman now Reſident, or to ſend any other, and they themſelves know that there was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in me (as I bleſs God there was an innocency in me) unto any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do them any harm; for my Maſters Commands were point-blank the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I was onely ſent for their good: as I never owned the Title, ſo the very Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves ſpeaking no other: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſo much as think of any manner
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65909:165"/>of Addreſs unto the <hi>Grand Seigniour,</hi> but gave him the Letter from my Maſter; the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> that were there preſent, may, when they pleaſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſo much. This I would inſert, That thoſe Gentlemen, as they have been lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers by the miſcarriages of others, may now have no breach of their charity with me; but if it be, as it ſeems it is now in this Country, a Sin to be Loyal, I hope my God hath forgiven that, when it is upon harmleſs employment, not invading any, according to his juſt Maſters Order; for indeed I have bin alwais bred up in that <hi>Religion;</hi> my Allegiance hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into my <hi>Religion,</hi> and I have thought it a great part of the ſervice due from me to Almighty God, to ſerve the King (<hi>putting off his Hat.</hi>) I need not make any Apology for any thing in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſent things in <hi>England,</hi> for were I (as I ſpake before my Judges) as evil, as my Sentence hath made me black, it were impoſſible for me to have prejudiced any body in <hi>England,</hi> or to <hi>England</hi> belonging in that employment; but I bleſs God for his infinite mercy in Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>putting off his Hat</hi>) who hath brought me home to him here in this
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65909:165"/>way, it was the beſt Phyſick for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my Soul, and thoſe that have done it, have no more power then that of my body. I leave nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, but that I am willing to part withal, all that I am going to is deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And that you may all know that Almighty God hath totally wrought in me a total Denial of my ſelf; and that there is that perfect <hi>Reformation</hi> of me within, and of my own corruption, by the bleſſed aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit; I deſire Almighty God in the abundance of the bowels of his mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, not only to forgive every Enemy, (if any ſuch be in the World, here, or whereſoever) but to bring him into his Boſom ſo much good and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as he may at any time, whether the Cauſe were juſt or unjuſt, have wiſhed me any manner of evil; for I take him to be the happy inſtrument of bringing me to Heaven. It is tedious, but I have an inward comfort, I bleſs Almighty God; (pray Gentlemen give me leave, <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome that preſt upon him</hi>) I ſhould never do it, but to give ſatisfaction to all charitable hearts.

               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Hide.</hi> But as to that part, Maſter Sheriff, that did concern the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial (as it was affirmed by <hi>Maſter At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General</hi>) of my Maſters employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Truly landing at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I told that <hi>Council,</hi> there was juſt Commiſſions to an old Officer by the bleſſing of God, I have by me; and I have other good things that God hath bleſſed me withall, more then all the good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the World, that are not the <hi>Grand Seigniour's</hi> Slaves: And we that are Merchants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, we allow our ſelves any ſufferance that may conduce to our own ſafety, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of Trade, or preſervation of what is ours. Why I had by the grace of my gracious Maſter a confirmation of my old Commiſſion of <hi>Conſulage</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> But as to the Embaſſie, no more then my Credential Letters did ſpeak, nor no more then that I attempted; an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternuncio</hi> they call it in thoſe places, which is a Meſſenger between the one and the other KING: They both unhappily died of ſeveral Deaths, and both violent too. And it is a Cuſtom not unknown to you, Maſter Sheriff, and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65909:166"/>that practice in the World, that Princes of courſe, for the continuance of Amity, do ſend Meſſengers where there is Peace, that the tranſaction of thoſe publique expreſſiens of reciprocal Affection may be performed; but for Embaſſie, God forbid I ſhould own it, I never had it; however, they have uſed it as the happy means to bring me to God this day. I beſeech God in the Bowels of my Saviour, to forgive thoſe people that have done it; I owe them no harm, ſo God pay them home with all the good of this, and an everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>As for power, I have been long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent here in <hi>England,</hi> I meddle with none: Sufficient to me is Gods grace to to the ſalvation of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>I have been alwayes fearful of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Almighty God, according to the grace he hath given me, but to learn new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and new Wayes, (that I muſt ſay Mr. Sheriff to you, and all others that hear me, I cannot diſpence with my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to give offence to Almighty God.

               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Hide.</hi> I humbly thank you for remembring me of it, and if any be here of the <hi>Turky</hi> Company this day, or any Friend of theirs, I ſhall deſire them from a dying Man, to take this Truth; That neither my Brother, my innocent

            <p>THis perſon was ingaged and trapan'd into the ſame unfortunate buſineſs with <hi>Colonel Andrews,</hi> on purpoſe by his means to draw in alſo Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> of whom before, he having been a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and retainer to the ſaid Knight many years before. He had alſo born office, and had a command under him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time Sir <hi>John</hi> ſerv'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and numbred himſelf afterwards amongſt theſe, who being uncommiſſioned, were generally known by the name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe accounts he became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them, eſpecially of the men at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who by their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſearching into his diſcontents, ſoon worked him into the Plot. A capacious deſign it was, which comprehended and included all intereſts, <hi>Cavalier, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> and <hi>Leveller,</hi> together with thoſe formerly caſhier'd Officers under <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and which had it taken its wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended effect, would have made them appear ſo cunning and terrible, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65909:171"/>and terrified all men againſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, or endeavouring againſt the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, that their new <hi>Common-wealth</hi> would have been a ſolitude or wilderneſs, where like beaſts, not men, we ſhould have been afraid one of another.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Andrews</hi> at his taking, was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that this perſon was of the gang that betrayed him, but in appeared to the contrary, for <hi>Barnard</hi> had clearly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt him with the reality and feaſibleneſs. of the deſign, into which he was ſo rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally as he thought, and upon ſuch ſure grounds engaged, ſuch and ſuch great perſons being nominated as principal therein, that not onely it was his belief, but his confidence, on which he had raiſed great hopes of advantage to himſelf, that this meritorious piece of ſervice would take effect.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo certain was he, that in the laſt trick put upon <hi>Colonel Andrews</hi> in reſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the drawing in of Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> which was a menace, that if the Colonel did not procure Sir <hi>Johns</hi> hand and ſeal, the Confederates would themſelves go over to the King in <hi>Holland,</hi> and give ſuch an account of the affair to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as ſhould tend little to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and

This conceit was ſo rooted in him, that he quitted it not till he was really ſurpriſed and in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody.</p>
            <p>Nay, when there, ſo ſtrong was his fancy, and ſo ſet upon the iſſue of this buſineſſe, that he complained to himſelf of the Colonel, through whoſe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and ſlow procedure therein, he thought it only miſcarried, not yet dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was made the ſtalkingly-horſe to his as well as their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>It was imagined that they would have contented themſelves with that induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice he did them, by ſo exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alizing their counterfeit plot, as a bird ſet to chirp others, by his merry note, into the ſnare; but no ſuch matter, having miſt the great ones they would be ſure of the ſmall, to give ſome ſatisfaction to their unſatiable thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But all availed nothing, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned more for the ſlaughter then they or their Engines could bring into the ſnare, and therefore be muſt die for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that whatever elſe they wanted, they might not fail in that, ſo that after ſome adjournments of the Court, as before is ſpecified, they called him to the Bar, and for that crime aforeſaid condemned him, he in vain obteſting and imploring their favour, as in a matter wherein the State and their cauſe had received little preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or diſadvantage, but ſeeing their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65909:174"/>could not be mitigated by words, he frankly told them he was not afraid to die for his cauſe, and compoſed himſelf for his ſentence, which was pronounced againſt him after ſome aggravations of his fact with more then uſual acerbity.</p>
            <p>Much ſtir there was made for a reprieve for him by his wife, and friends of hers, then in Authority, but reaſon of State, as they told her, prevailed againſt all pleas and arguments for mercy, though ſhe was flattered but the day he died, he ſhould be reprieved and finally pardoned, which glad tidings the poor overjoyed woman carried him about noon to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where they were merry and ſolacing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which pleaſantneſs of mind about two a clock ſhe left him, and at four came the Warrant for his preſent Execution (a moſt deviliſh cruelty) which, as is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for fear of the ſea-men, by whom he was well beloved, was executed at ſix of the clock the night aforeſaid, upon the ground under the Scaffold, where he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and Chriſtianly ſuffered, and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſoul into the hands of his Creator.</p>

            <p>For without all doubt, the bottom of their deſign was the Kings Reſtauration and however it was clog'd with Salves and Conditions for themſelves and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (which abates ſomething of the luſtre, though not of the worth of this Crown) yet the main was Loyaltie, which they hoped to vindicate and evince to the World, who had hard thoughts of them in the matter of the Kings Death in the previous Method thereunto.</p>

            <p> Their chief meeting-place was Mr. <hi>Love's,</hi> where their intelligence was communicated, Letters read, and advice given upon the ſeveral Emergencies of that Buſineſſe; which proceeded ſo far, that the King and his Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having ended the Treaty, and his Majeſtie arrived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whether <hi>Cromwel</hi> with the Engliſh Armie was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo advanced, and had worſted the <hi>Kirks</hi> Armie at <hi>Dunbar;</hi> They concluded of raiſing an Armie in this Kingdom to the aſſiſtance of that <hi>Nation,</hi> and the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this from the ſlavery and Tyrannie it ſuffered under.</p>
            <p>This paſſed through ſo many hands, engaged in it, and was ſo publiquely own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>Council of State</hi> had very early notice of the whole Deſign, ſo that they dained moſt part of the while in the Net; information being given of every daies proceedings, and of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or acceſſes of perſons to the Deſign: which ſoon after, when they had let it run as far, as without danger they might truſt it, they drew the Curtain, and apprehended moſt of the aforeſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and brought them to Trial before a

            <p>If we deduce him from his glorious ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, we ſee him deſcended from a moſt ancient and illuſtrious Family, in which Loyaltie was one of the Gentilitions in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vertues, derived in the ſucceſſion of thoſe <hi>Heroes,</hi> who to this day adorn'd the noble name of <hi>Stanley,</hi> ſo memorated and famed in our <hi>Annals,</hi> eſpecially in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. direct Ancreſtor to his preſent Majeſtie.</p>

            <p>But this Noble Earl, whoſe unworthie Fate we now deplore, came neareſt that great Pattern; the Times, concurring with the activity of his mind, afforded him the advantage of employing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing that ſtock of Prudence and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which had ſo long been treaſured up in the loines of his Princely Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and yet to the ſcandal and reproach of that Age, rewarding all his Honourable Attchievements with a moſt lamented <hi>Catastrophy.</hi>

            <p>At <hi>White-Ladies,</hi> whither by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Earl the King was guided; he took his leave of his Majeſtie, having firſt taken care of his ſecurity, where alſo

            <p>At his departure he fell on his knees and wept, and then conjured the Pendants to be faithfully careful of his Majeſties perſon, dearer to him then ten thouſand lives; and ſo betook himſelf again to flight in company of the ſame retinue, who made after the road the <hi>Scotch</hi> horſe they had taken under <hi>David Leſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Newport</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them, but with the ſame Col. <hi>Lilburn</hi> at their heels, who fell into the Town, and after a ſhort diſpute, diſperſed and took moſt of the party, among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal whereof was this Noble and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Earl, the Earl of <hi>Landerdale,</hi> Lord <hi>Sinclare,</hi> and others, the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> ſtrangely making his eſcape.</p>

               <p>He was brought to a Houſe in the Town near the Croſſe, where the Scaffold was raiſed: and as he paſſed by, ſaid, [<hi>VENIO DOMINE</hi>] <hi>I am prepared to fulfil thy will, O my God: this Scaffold muſt be my Croſs: Bleſſed Saviour, I take it up wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and follow thee.</hi>] From thence going into a Chamber with ſome Friends
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65909:180"/>and ſervants, he was advertiſed by the Commander in Chief, that he had till three a clock allowed him to prepare for death, for indeed the Scaffold was not ready: the people of the Town &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try generally refuſing to carry ſo much as a plank, or ſtrike a nail, or to lend any aſſiſtance to that work, their cry being generally in the ſtreets: <hi>O ſad day, O woful day! ſhall the good Earl of</hi> Derby <hi>die here?</hi> Many ſad loſſes have we had in this War, but none like unto this; for now the Ancient Honour of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt ſuffer here: And to add to his trouble, moſt of the Timber that built the Scaffold, was of the ruines of <hi>Latham</hi>-Houſe; but nothing could alter his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips reſolution and courage: for with a ſtedfaſt compoſed countenancy, and a chearful, he called the company which were preſent to prayers with him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhewed admirable ſervence, and a kind of humble importunity with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that he would pardon his ſins, be merciful to his Soul; and be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to this Land, in reſtoring the <hi>King, Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> and that he would be a <hi>Husband</hi> to his <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> to his <hi>Children,</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> to all thoſe that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65909:181"/>ſuffered by his <hi>Loſſe,</hi> or that had been Friends to him.</p>
               <p>Riſing from prayer, he ſat down with a very pleaſant countenance; and aſſured the ſtanders by, that God had heard his prayers, which the bleſſed Spirit of God witneſſed unto him, in the preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he now felt in his Soul. Then he entered into a diſcourſe of his life, and beſeecht God to forgive him the dayes and time he had miſ-pent; and ſaid, it was his Comfort, that although he had not walked ſo circumſpectly as he ought to have done, yet he ever had a ſenſe of his ſins, and a tender reſpect to all the Services, Servants and Ordinances of his God; and that he knew God had mercy for him, that he had ſtrengthened and comforred him againſt all the terrours of death.</p>
               <p>After theſe, and ſome other words to this purpoſe, he deſired his Friends and the people by to pray with him again; which when he had ended, riſing from his knees, he appeared fully ſatisfied of a gracious return to his prayers, and never after ſhewed any ſadneſs in his countenance.</p>
               <p>His next buſineſs was with his <hi>Son</hi> the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> whom he publiquely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

               </p>
               <p>Then deſired to be private in the room himſelf; where he was obſerved to be about half an hour upon his knees with frequent interjections of groans and ſighs before his God. Then when he called the company in again, his eyes witneſſed to us, that he had abundantly mixed <hi>Tears</hi> with his <hi>Prayers;</hi> he told us that he was very willing to leave the World, bering aſſured by the Teſtimony of Gods Spiit, that he ſhould be carried from Troube, to Reſt and Peace, from Sorrow to Joy, from Life to Death, and that Death
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65909:182"/>had no other bitterneſs in it to him, but that it took him from his dear Wife and Children; whom he <hi>humbly</hi> commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Protection and Providence of a better <hi>Husband,</hi> and a better <hi>Father;</hi> and that he did not doubt, but that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and they who ſat in the Seat of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would make proviſion for them, hoping that his death might ſatisfie all thoſe who ſought his life, whom he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave, and deſired God to do the like. Then calling for his Son, he took his leave of him, and bleſſed him; which indeed would have grieved any ones heart (though never ſo hardened) to ſee the parting of him now with his Son, and with his two Daughters, the Lady <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Amely Stanley,</hi> upon the Road betwixt <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Bolton</hi> the day before.</p>

            <p>I Muſt confeſs my ſelf at a loſſe here but though I could receive nothing elſe but his Name; yet to that there is ſo much due on this account of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> that I durſt not omit him, putting hereby an occaſion into the hands of this Gentlemans Relations, to reſcue his, and perpetuate their Name to after Ages.</p>
            <p>I conceive him to be one of thoſe loyal Gentlemen, who came in with the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> then Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi> or Colonel <hi>Howard,</hi> my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſericks</hi> Son to the King at <hi>Worcester;</hi> and, who for his former Services done the King in the War before, was obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their malice.</p>
            <p>Moſt certain it was, he was taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and obſerved to be very active in that Engagement at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in the flight from whence he was taken, though moſt of the other Engliſh eſcaped by the favour and concealment of the Country; (nor did ever the <hi>Scots</hi> finde civiller uſage after a Defeat) ſave thoſe who

            <p>After he was taken he was conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> a place which the King from <hi>Worceſter</hi> had ſummoned by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Colonel <hi>Mackworth</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which Royal Command they thought fit to queſtion with loyal Blood: as they pretended to expiate the ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Bolton</hi> by Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with the murder of the Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi>

               <hi>OLiver Cromwel,</hi> that Monſter of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh production, had but newly invaded the Magiſtracy over theſe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> when, as the <hi>Hydra</hi> before him had done; he commenced his Tyrannical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment with a Sacrifice of Loyal blood, which all along cemented the frame of his five yeares Uſurpation, as the Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> were ſaid to be mortar'd.</p>
            <p>A curſed Rule it was among thoſe <hi>State-Innovators,</hi> that there was no ſurer way of eſtabliſhing their Tyrannie, and bring their Models to any ſound conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by profuſely letting blood, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Pluriſie of ſo many dangers, which their evil and abominable actions did daily threaten them.</p>
            <p>This they termed <hi>Preventional Cure;</hi> for ſuſpecting all hands to be about their eares, they reſolved to be before hand with ſome: that the terror of the Example, being contrary to all reaſon, Juſtice and Law, and a perfect avowing of their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65909:192"/>might reach to every man, that who with the ſenſe of ſo apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and deſtruction out of which, once engaged, there was no reſcue or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but by death, might be ſtupified into a degenerous fear, and abject ſervility of mind, to endure whatever their inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Domination ſhould load upon them.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe His Engines were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied at once upon all ſorts of men, though finding it impoſſible to engage or ſet any of the Nobility who had a ſmall taſt of what uſage they might expect by the Death of 4 eminent Lords: they at Laſt confined themſelves to the middle rank of the people, Gentry and Citizens, and of thoſe, not the puny and weak, but the reſolute, learned and couragious, whoſe blood being of price and value might be of ſome religſh to them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever bitter and abominable ſoever to all the World beſides, being the thing they intended.</p>
            <p>A <hi>High Court of Justice</hi> is therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the novel Authority of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, and to keep even pace, with the ſetting of it up, divers perſons are apprehonded and Committed; amongſt
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65909:192"/>others this Noble Gentleman, Colonel <hi>John Gerhard,</hi> his Brother <hi>Mr. Charles Gerhard,</hi> Brothers to the Honourable Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerhard;</hi> Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of the Free-School at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Somerſet Fox,</hi> and others; theſe were brought before that Bar of the <hi>High Court,</hi> where bloody <hi>Liſle</hi> was then <hi>Preſident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Crime was an offence count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one of thoſe forty two Articles of the <hi>Inſtrument of Government,</hi> which <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi> ſwore to at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> at his firſt ſeizure of the Government, being a deſign againſt the Life of that Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This was feizible to the belief of all men, for few there were that owed him not that kindneſſe, and therefore the colour of Truth was enough, and onely requiſite to blanch out the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and odiouſneſſe of the illegall proceedings and other barbarous dreſſe of miſchief and villany.</p>
            <p>But theſe Gentlemen were no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in any ſuch deſign, ſave only as they were prompted, and had ſome tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſuggeſtions which they never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome trapanning words to that purpoſe, which had their danger not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65909:193"/>to their memory, had been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgot by them, though made records againſt them by thoſe who were hired deeply to ſwear againſt them, what they had by the by, but whiſpered to them. See more in Mr. <hi>Gerhards</hi> Speech.</p>
            <p>But to ſtrengthen and ſecond this Device, and to ſix their plot upon them, they do not onely relye on their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for evidence, but with promiſe of life and pardon to one of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Complices in the buſineſſe, they undermine his integrity, and blow up the lives of the other. They tell him they can ſufficiently prove it, and that the onely way to ſave himſelf is by a free Confeſſion and deſiring the clemency of the Court; thereupon Mr. <hi>Somerſet Fox</hi> acknowledgeth the pretended Crime, and referred himſelf to them for mercy, and Mr. <hi>Gerhard</hi> the younger, being not above the age of nineteen yeares gives ſome ſuch like Teſtimony againſt his own Brother, being not of that mature reſolution to withſtand the fear of Death, which menaced himſelf; whereupon this Noble Colonel was condemned by the ſaid pretended Court for Treaſon in conſpiring the death of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> which
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65909:193"/>he undauntedly (having made a very excellent Defence againſt the ſuppoſed Fact, and at laſt denyed their Authority) and very chearfully received.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> was the next, againſt whom they had ſuborned a blind Miniſter, one that had been fed and ſuſtained by the charity of this <hi>Martyr.</hi> The frequent converſe this man uſed with him, gave <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Spies a fit opportunitie of effecting their projected Deſign upon him; for ſeeing the indigence and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of that blind, wretched man, they forthwith cloſed with him, and with great promiſes of Penſions and ſuch like proditory Reward, drew the unwary man into the guilt of a moſt ſhamefull Treachery.</p>
            <p>For having ſounded the mind of his Benefactor and good Friend in reference to the Fines, and particularly about the <hi>Protectors</hi> Uſurpation, by which the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> being now reduced to a kind of Monarchical Government, and the people diſcerning thereby the Cheats put upon them by the Reformation; it was not to be doubted, but if the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant were removed, or otherwayes laid aſide, the Royal intereſt would be glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65909:194"/>embraced, and without any difficulty reaſſumed to its Authority; he caught hold of ſome words by way of diſcourſe, which as the judgement and inclination of Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> led him, were ſomething to the purpoſe of their Deſign.</p>
            <p>Theſe words were preſently taken hold of, and upon this blind mans Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations more enlarged, with ſeveral Circumſtances inſerted, which their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments had furniſhed them with out of their ſtrict watch and obſervation of all his Company, Wayes and Actions, which at his Trial were inſtanced, and the Examinations produced to prove them.</p>
            <p>At the recitals whereof, the blind man, whether prickt in conſcience for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible ingratitude, or ſome preſent cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage infuſed into him for to evidence the oppreſſed innocence of the priſoner at Bar, who had a ſad and numerous Family at home, denyed and diſowned the ſad Examination, and the words or Narrative therein ſet down to be his, but that he was abuſed thereby, and ſo perſiſted, to the great confuſion and puzzle of the Court, till ſuch time as <hi>Frontleſſe Liſle</hi> averred it was his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65909:194"/>Act, and that it appeared he had been ſince tampered withal, and that the Court would take no notice of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication.</p>
            <p>So this proceeded to Sentence againſt him, which was, that for his Treaſon, &amp;c. he ſhould be hanged, and ſo was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to priſon again.</p>
            <p>On the 10th. day of <hi>July,</hi> 1654. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Gerhard</hi> was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> where imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after <hi>Don Pantaleon Sa</hi> the <hi>Pör<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Embaſſadours Brother (for a Riot committed at the new <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where this unfortunate Gentleman valiantly oppoſed him, and his aſſiſtance to the hazard of his life) was executed. They both agreed in this fatal determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their lives, though not in the manner of parting with them, the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> with ſome kind of reluctancy; this with the braveſt and moſt Chriſtian wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe imaginable, which he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his dying geſture and words, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned hereunto,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Vowel,</hi> on the 10th. day of <hi>July</hi> was likewiſe brought to <hi>Charing-Croſſe,</hi> where he was readier for his death then that for him; the Gibbet being not fixed
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65909:195"/>he was conveighed to the <hi>Charing-Croſs Tavern,</hi> where he like a true Chriſtian Souldier behaved himſelf, (having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared himſelf for his departure) freely diſcourſing of the Kings indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unconquerable Right to his Crownes; and that though for a time it might be ſuppreſſed, yet moſt certainly God in his righteous Judgement would not long delay his vindication to the Mind and confuſion of his rebellious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and that they could take no ſpeedier courſe to bring it down upon their heads then by murthering his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and that though it were a ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction on him in regard of his diſtreſſed Family, yet he doubted not but it would prove to his everlaſting glory, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupport of his Relations then he could provide for them. [And I hope his words with the latter part thereof be as happily verified as in the former]</p>
            <p>Being called again to his Execution, he took leave of a number of people, who preſſed in to comfort him, and to pray God to ſtrengthen him; whom with like gracious and Chriſtian expreſſions he chearfully thanked. At the Gibbet there was no Ladder ſet, not any for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65909:195"/>brought: ſo retrograde and averſe had Providence diſpoſed of things to the moſt abominable murther, as if it had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitated its deteſtation thereof; nor could any be procured from the Neighbours thereabouts, or any other place, all men denying to be the leaſt acceſſary to that infamous buſineſs; thereupon a Joyn-ſtoo was fought from the <hi>Mews,</hi> and upon that he was put; that by how many degrees he was nearer the Earth at his fall by ſo many degres he might be higher in glory in He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having devoutly prayed for himſelf, the King, Church and Kingdom, and for the conſummation of this life into bliſs, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt ſome few words to the people (which were too harſh for the eares of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to whom they were principally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) but was ſoon ſilenced, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſpeak out the remainder. Then after a ſhort permiſſion of ſome few <hi>Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations</hi> wherewith he recommended his departing Soul to God, the ſtool was drawn from under him, and ſo he quietly paſt hence to a glorious ſtate of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Henſhaw,</hi> now Major of the City Regiment of Horſe, was ſaid to be
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65909:196"/>concerned in this buſineſs.

               <p>IT was thought needle ſſe by the friends of Col. <hi>Gerhard,</hi> to declare any thing concerning his ſufferings unto the World, more then in their ſight, had not the ſacrilegious malice of the laſt weekly Pamphlet thrown ſome ſtains upon his name, and ſo incenſed them to a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as pious as his death was. 'Tis moſt certain, that there can no blots ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on true honour, which ſuch weak fellows endeavour againſt it: Theſe are curſed beaſts, but their horns are ſhort; ſepulchral dogs! that ſcrape up graves, and violate the dead, and are fierce and ravenous, but yet dogs ſtill. And all worthy people will call their railing, praiſe, and what they intend a barking infamy the greateſt merit. Yet becauſe every underſtanding is not of the ſame brightneſs, and thoſe putrid libels may by ill chance fall into ſome innocent hand hereafter (and yet ſure ſuch vermine ſhould not be endured long) therefore let wiſe and good men pardon him that hath undertaken this juſtice for that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

Or diſhonour that blood with feeble tears, which was ſhed ſo like the holy Martyrs? All that knew this perſon cannot but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his generous reſolution, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his great courage fell leſſe then it ſelf (as that viper hiſſeth) or did not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſe greater now, when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was twiſted with the Gentlemen, let this faithful relation witneſs.

               </p>
               <p>From the firſt day of his impriſonment he foreſaw the heavy ſentence hovering upon him, and therefore gave all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſecure himſelf againſt it; that
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65909:197"/>however he underwent a temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, he might eſcape an eternal. But after that ſad doom was pronounced then he beſtirred himſelf amain, and made double haſt for heaven, it was for his life, and therefore he would looſe no minute, but the ſame night gave directions to a dear friend for a Miniſter (whom he knew to have long honoured his family) to be brought unto him early next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it pleaſed Authority to gratifie him in this great deſire, ſo that an order was ſent freely for the quiet admiſſion of any ſuch perſon to him.

There were ſome other Miniſters of great obſervation for gravity and godlineſſe, who viſited him, and who I am confident will put their ſeal to this truth with me, that they found him meek, humble, modeſt, penitent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, not far from the Kingdom of God, if not already in it: but I have good hope he was in poſſeſſion, and ſo had he, through grace. Upon the morning (which was the laſt he muſt ſee till that

At his lodging he deſired the Sheriffe that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Miniſter and three others that were his friends and ſervants to go upon the Scaffold with him, which as it was ſeaſonable wiſdome in him to deſire, ſo was it a fortunate kindneſſe from them that granted it, elſe it may be their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony might have been wanting to his injured reputation. He took leave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on the Houſhold where he was as a priſoner, and was ſo clearly collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every thing he did, that he went out of his way into the kitchin to bid his Lanlady farewell, giving thanks for her reſpects during his bonds, which he ſaid he ſhould die in to her. As he paſſed by the Guards in the Tower, he gave them mony twice, and told them; he ſhould trouble them no longer, being on his remove to better Guards. He walked along to the Scaffold on Tower-Hill, ſhewing a great deal both of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reſpect to the people, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally lamented him, and prayed for him.

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65909:199"/>came to (or rather leap'd upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold) for he was ſo far from flagging when to tread that Tragical ſtage, that many obſerved how ſprightfully he ſeem'd to skip up the ſteps to it, as if he had gone to dance there rather then to die) his grim executioner preſented himſelf to him, to whom with a chearfull ſmile he ſaid, <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come honeſt friend:</hi> And deſiring to ſee his Ax, he took it into his hands, and kiſſing it, with a pretty glance of his eye (which was a natural lovelineſſe in him) towards the Miniſter, he ſaid, <hi>This will do the deed I warrant it.</hi> The Scaffold was very much crowded with people; yet as well as he could he made ſome turns to and ſro upon it, with a paper (which he had taken out of his pocket) in his hand, wherein it ſeemes he had prepared ſome heads of a ſpeech which he intended to have delivered: but the Sheriff and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant told him, if he ſpoke any thing it muſt be very brief, and that they muſt not ſuffer him to ſpeak any thing that was ſeditious; <hi>Well Gentlemen</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>your will be done; but (God be praiſed) I never yet had to do with any thing that was ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious! I would fain have ſpoken ſomething to clear my ſelf to the world, according to the

Then turning himſelf to the people, and putting off his hat, he told them, <hi>That he was not permitted to ſpeak a few words according to his intention, yet he doubted not but what he would have ſaid would come to their eyes, though it muſt not come to their ears: But this</hi> I <hi>deſire all to take notice of,</hi> and this he ſpoke (with a double vehemence) <hi>that</hi> I <hi>die a faithful ſubject and ſervant to King</hi> Charles <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, whom</hi> I <hi>pray God to bleſs and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65909:200"/>an act of true Chriſtian love, but as his caſe ſtood, love was not enough; He ought to deal in this buſineſs (upon which his life lay) with all candour and ſincerity, not concealing any thing of that nature as was charged againſt him, as far as he might gloriſie God, and ſerve the publick good. Upon which lifting up his eyes towards heaven, and laying his hand upon his breaſt, <hi>Oh Sir,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>if there had been any ſuch thing in this breaſt, would</hi> I <hi>not have revealed it before this time!</hi> I <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the ſight of Almighty God,</hi> I <hi>know no more of any ſuch deſign, but only what</hi> I <hi>have often acknowledged, that it was moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxed to me by</hi> Major Henſhaw, (<hi>who</hi> I <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe is in their hands</hi>) <hi>and debated twice or thrice when</hi> I <hi>was with him: but</hi> I <hi>never en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was many times preſſing me to nominate what perſons</hi> I <hi>knew</hi> I <hi>could bring, &amp; to have their names; but let them ſhew any ſuch thing if they can againſt me. But</hi> I <hi>am certain he is in their hands.</hi> Pawſing here a little, and fetching a turn or two upon the Scaffold, being very hot (as he had baen all that morning) he call'd for ſome ſmall beer, which he had
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65909:201"/>given order to be ready, and was brought thither in a ſtone bottle, of which he drank a little once or twice. Then the Miniſter went to him, and minded him that ſomething might be expected from him as to his Religion, and diſpoſition to dye. To which gathering up an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reſolution in his face) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>I dy a Chriſtian, a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, according to that Faith and Religion which was profeſſed by the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>in the time of our late King of bleſſed memory. And I praiſe God I am ſo fitted and ready to dye, that I am confident by the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, that my ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and my ſalvation is at hand.</hi> Then turning about he called for his waſt-cote and cap, and throwing off his doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, put them on, whilſt his ſervants help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put up his hair. His waſt-coat was not very clean, which he took notice of to his man: <hi>but 'tis no great matter ſaith he, if the heart be clean, ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s well enough.</hi> Being thus prepared, he calls for the Block: and viewing it (as with delight) laid himſelf down upon it to ſee how it would fit, and was ſo far from ſinking at the ſight of it, that he almoſt play'd with it: and riſing quickly pulls a little paper-book
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65909:201"/>out of his pocket, which he gave to the Miniſter, willing him to find that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prayer which was proper for that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but the crowd being great, he could not quickly find it, ſo that he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down with the book open a while in his hand as if he had read; but quickly ſhut it, and prayed with great expreſſions of fervency by himſelf. When he had done, the Lieutenant ſaid ſomething to him (as it ſeems) concerning his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> that had witneſſed againſt him; I know not what the Lieutenant ſaid, (for he ſpake low) but Mr. <hi>Gerhard</hi> ſpake aloud, and replyed paſſionatly O <hi>Chriſt Sir! I love my poor brother with all my heart, he is but a youth and was terrified, I know how he was dealt with; tell him I love him as well as ever I lov'd him in my life. And commend me to my brother Sir</hi> Gilbert, <hi>whoſe releaſe I beſeech you Sir to aſſiſt: there being no more cauſe, that I know of for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment then only that he was found in the ſame bed with me, which ſure is no capital crime.</hi> Having ſaid this, he took his leave of him and the Sheriff, and all he knew on the ſtage: and turning about once more to the people, deſired them to pray for him, himſelf kneeling
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65909:202"/>down with the Miniſter, laid his hand in his boſom, and they prayed together the laſt time. After this he bids them all fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well again, <hi>and beſought them to remember they had a poor Soveraign abroad who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be remembred.</hi> Then forgiving the Executioner and ſaluting the Miniſter with his laſt embrace and kiſſes, he bow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſtroak of death, with as much Chriſtian meekneſſe and noble courage mix'd together, as I beleive was ever ſeen in any that had bled upon that Altar. And this all the people that were Spectators, did ſeem to underſtand and acknowledge: beholding his fatal blow with an univerſal ſadneſs and ſilence; whereas, when the other Gentleman fell quickly after upon another ſcore of blood and ryot, they gave a great and general ſhout, as applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Juſtice of the <hi>Portugals</hi> death; but pittying and bewailing the untimely fall of ſo brave and magnanimous a ſpirit as did (through all the clouds of death) ſhine gloriouſly in this unfortunate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>

               <p>How many of you have drawn your Swords, you do not know for what? How many of you keep drawn your Swords, you do not know for what?

            <p>This was fair intimation for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to deſiſt: but, believing this ſpoken by him out of a real fear of their Power; the Deſigne being univerſally laid; and that it was beyond his power to prevent it, and no doubt ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and foundation of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize they alſo had from the Parliament, they reſolved to proceed to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>Maning</hi> at laſt came to be diſcovered to the King, when his Friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were betrayed and undone, and the whole deſign fruſtrated, and was deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſhot to Death at a Caſtle in the Duke of <hi>Newburghs</hi> Country. But this, as I ſaid, was too late; for, the <hi>Western</hi> Aſſociation which was to be commanded by Sir <hi>Joſeph Wagſtaffe,</hi> according to the time agreed on, roſe in part at <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> at ſuch time as the Judges were come thither in Circuit. Here appeared to the number of two or three hundred Horſe on Monday morning in <hi>Maxch,</hi> where we having ſeized ſome of the Lawyers Horſes, and taken away the Judges Commiſſions: they marched to <hi>Blandford,</hi> where Col. <hi>Penruddock</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the King, and ſo on <hi>Westward:</hi> ſome leaving, but none joyning with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi> had ſo ordered his buſineſſe, that his Troops were ready in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but knowing that this riſing would be the firſt and moſt general, gave them fair time and opportunity of Rendeſvouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no more but onely two Troops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Butler,</hi> then upon their march thither from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> being near thereabouts;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65909:209"/>but as ſoon as ever they were up Forces were drawn together from ſeveral places to prevent their diſperſing and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The Royaliſts having marched day and night, came at laſt wearied and tyred to <hi>Southmolton</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> where they took up Quarters for that night, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where they expected an additional ſtrength, both from that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and from Forreign parts there to be landed: But about ten a clock that night, Captain <hi>

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65909:210"/>into <hi>Exeter</hi> Goal, where lay while the next Aſſizes. In the mean time, ſeveral other perſons engaged in the ſame fatal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, were apprehended at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and other places, and ſecured in the ſeveral Goals, till ſuch time, as <hi>Cromwel</hi> to make himſelf more abſolute, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and forced ſuch Judges as he had deſigned for the Summer Circuit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his inſtructions, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Sheriffs, upon pains of the ſame diſpleaſure, had empannelled Juries for his turn.</p>
            <p>I omit wilfully the names of both Judges and Juries, not ſo much for their ſakes, as the memory of that obtruſion upon the Lawes, being that murther was countenanced by them while a <hi>High Court of Juſtice</hi> was ready at hand, and it portended ſome ill irrecoverable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the generality of the <hi>Nation,</hi> where that paſſed by legal Verdict. So great a ſhame to us that challenge Engliſh Freedom, and have conteſted ſo often with our Princes for <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that it cannot paſs our Pen without burning our fingers: not onely ſtygmatize that age, but ſet a mark on the future.</p>
            <p>In the Summer Aſſizes, as before is ſaid,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65909:210"/>the Judges went their Circuit; but before that time, <hi>Cromwel</hi> had cauſed Col. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruddock,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> related to his Highneſs-ſhip, to be brought up to be examined before him, which, they being in the cuſtody of the <hi>Serjeant at Armes,</hi> ſeveral times underwent in reference to a further diſcovery of other perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the buſineſs: but that took not with them, who had founded their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie upon a Rock, which ſome guſts and violent ſtorms might batter, but never pierce nor enter.</p>
            <p>They were not wanting in an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way to their own preſervation, while they had this ſeeming advantage, (as knowing how grievous to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies this their deſtruction would prove) of ſtaying here; Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> got off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed afterwards, but Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the extremity of their own Law, the Sword, which had given him quarter for life at his taking.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Penruddock</hi> being removed to his priſon at <hi>Exeter,</hi> after they had finiſhed their <hi>Inquiſition</hi> with him, at his departure deſired the prayers of ſeveral Congregations in <hi>London,</hi> for a ſupply of comfort to him in his diſtreſſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65909:211"/>(being then bound for his laſt home, and aſſuredly knowing his near and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable diſſolution) which was earneſtly and loyally endeavoured, even in thoſe dangerous times.</p>
            <p>They were both preſently re-guarded to their former Priſons to expect their Doom, which not long awaited them and their partakers; for, at the Aſſizes held in the County of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> in the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> they were indited for Treaſon, in levying War again the <hi>Protector,</hi> and by a perjured Jury found guilty, according to that precedent newly brought to them from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where the ſame Charge was exhibited, and for Example proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Effect.</p>
            <p>In fine, Judgement was given againſt them upon this Conviction, and ſome 16 ſuffered the pains and penalties thereof: whoſe Names we refer to an enſuing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue: only deſiring you to be ſatisfied with the brief account of the principal perſons here, becauſe it will be not only ſome trouble to write their particular ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries involved in the general deſign of this Service, but by reaſon the whole was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by theſe mens Purſes &amp; Authority, and more ſignalized by their life &amp; death.</p>
            <pb n="401" facs="tcp:65909:211"/>
            <p> I preſume not neither to be punctual in the matter of Colonel <hi>Penruddock;</hi> for that he himſelf was abuſed in the hopes of the publiſhing his Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tryal, wherein the high injuſtice offered him would moſt plainly appear, eſpecially in the buſineſs of Capt. <hi>Crook,</hi> and therfore ſhall tranſmit the memory of this noble and Heroick Royaliſt, with as much honor &amp; ſolemn veneration, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation &amp; zeal againſt thoſe Times and Perſons, that envied us the Retroſpect of this his glory, by forbidding &amp; ſuppreſſing any account thereof to be publiſhed, that they might thereby conceal their baſe treachery and unlawful proceedings.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Penruddock</hi> thus butchered, Colonel <hi>Groves,</hi> a ſomewhat antient and very grave man, was brought upon the reaking Scaffold, he had been an Officer of that Dignity and Command in the Kings Armies before; and therefore that honourable ſolemnity of murther was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him. He ſpoke at his Trial little to his Judges, whoſe enjoyned buſineſs and meritorious Service with <hi>Oliver,</hi> he well knew was to bereave him of his life; but addreſt himſelf wholly to the Jury, who were a packt number of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65909:212"/>and, who, Serpent like, were deaf to his Charmes of Reaſon and Law, though preſſed and tenacioufly urged by him.</p>
            <p>As he ſaid little at the Bar, ſo he ſaid leſs at the Block, but piouſly and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended his Soul to God, deſiring him to forgive his Enemies, and ſo laid down his life, and ſlept in the Lord; their Speeches follow.</p>
            <p>After this Execution was paſt, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded (not becauſe they ſaw it pleaſed the people, for the Royal people of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> never beheld the like deteſtable ſight) in their violence againſt others of the meaner ſort, who were taken in that ſame buſineſs at <hi>Southmolton,</hi> who by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating malice were deſtined to the Gibbet, nine of whom ſuffered thereat, averting their moſt righteous Cauſe, and telling the Sheriff, a Knight of <hi>Olivers,</hi> that another account and eſtimate would not long after be made of them, to the ſhame and confuſion of their Enemies. After they were dead, they were all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably buried in that City, all ſorts of perſons in great numbers following them to their Graves, which was highly reſented, and ſtuck deeply in
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65909:212"/>
               <hi>Cromwels</hi> ſtomack, but he knew not which way to puniſh the City for that piety; no more then he could brook or prevent their charity; the Citizens from the time of the impriſonment of them, being above fourſcore in number, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them with all neceſſaries, even to abundance and ſuperfluity.</p>
            <p>But though he could not ſtop the giver, he found a way to hinder the receiver, for after the Aſſizes (wherein many more were condemned beſides them that were Executed, and the others ſtill kept in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in expectation of future tryal) he cauſed them to be tranſported to the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bado's,</hi> ſelling them as ſlaves to ſome of thoſe Turkiſh Merchants, who trade in the lives of men, as this Butcher <hi>Crommwel</hi> in their deaths, who ſold and employed them in thoſe Plantations, where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan clowns, or more properly villains, uſed and worked them beyond their ſtrength and endurance, which ſoon after the Tyrant was gone to his place, came to a hearing in Parliament, in <hi>Richards</hi> non-age.</p>
            <p>The ſame Judges at their return back held another Aſſize at <hi>Chard</hi> in <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where <hi>Cromwells</hi> Scouts had gleaned
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65909:213"/>up a few of thoſe ſcattered perſons, two whereof they murthered there, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Hunt,</hi> whom they had principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the gorge, gave them the ſlip in the habit of one of his Siſters, who ſtaid behind in his Chamber in bed, which they diſcovered not till morning, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, intolerable vexation of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who threatned all manner of deaths to the Jaylor.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot their errand at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where they likewiſe beheaded on Mr. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT hath ever been the cuſtom of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever when they come to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65909:214"/>die, to give ſome ſatisfaction to the world, whether they be guilty of the fact of which they ſtand charged. The crime for which they ſtand charged, the crime for which I am now to die, is Loyalty, (but) in this age call'd high Treaſon. I cannot deny but I was at <hi>Southmolton</hi> in this County: but whether my being there, or my actions there amount to ſo high a crime as high Treaſon, I leave it to the world and to the Law to judge. Truly, if I were concious to my ſelf of any baſe ends that I had in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aking, I would not be ſo injurious to my own ſoul, or diſingenuous to you as not to make a publique acknowledgment thereof. I ſuppoſe that divers perſons, according as they are biaſſed in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral intereſts and relations, give their opinions to the world concerning us. I conceive it is impoſſible therefore ſo to expreſſe my ſelf in this particular, as not to expoſe both my judgement and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the cenſure of many, which I ſhall leave behind me. Becauſe I will not put others (therefore) upon a breach of Charity concerning me or my actions, I have thought fit to decline all diſcourſes which may give them a capacity either
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65909:214"/>to enjure themſelves or me. My tryal was publick, and my ſeveral examinations (I believe) will be produced when I am in my grave. I will refer you therefore to the firſt, which I am ſure ſome of you heard, and to the later, which many of you (in good time) may ſee. Had Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Crook</hi> done himſelf and us that right which a Gentleman and a Souldier ought to have done, I had not now been here. The man I forgive with all my heart; but truly Gentlemen, his proteſting againſt thoſe Articles he himſelf with ſo many proteſtations and importunities put upon us, hath drawn ſo much diſhonour and blood upon his head, that I fear ſome heavy judgement will purſue him. Though he hath been falſe to us, I pray God I do not prove a true prophet to him.</p>
               <p>Nay, I muſt ſay more, that coming on the road to <hi>Exon,</hi> he the ſaid Captaine <hi>Crook</hi> told me, Sir <hi>Joſeph Wagſtaff</hi> was a gallant Gentleman, and that he was ſorry he was not taken with us; that then he might have had the benefit of our AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICLES, but now (ſaid he) I have beſet all the Country for him ſo that he cannot eſcape, but muſt be hanged.</p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:65909:215"/>
               <p> He alſo queſtioned me as I paſſed through <hi>Salisbury</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> whether he had given me conditions: Which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make appear to Major <hi>Butler,</hi> he interrupted me, and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſt ſaying, I profered him four hundred pounds to perform his Articles; which had been a ſtrange proffer of mine, had I not really conditioned with him. And I told him then (having found him unworthy) I would have given him five hundred pounds, believing him to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary. To make it yet farther appear, I injure him not by ſtiling him unworthy, after theſe Articles were given, he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Piſtol me, if I did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade another houſe to yeeld, which then were boldly reſiſting. To which my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanr <hi>John Biby</hi> (now a priſoner) replyed. I hope you will not be ſo unworthy as to break the Law of Arms.</p>
               <p>Thus much I am obliged to ſay to the honour of the ſouldiery, that they have been ſo far from breaking any Articles given to others, that they have rather bettered them then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>It is now our misfortune to be made preſidents and examples together: But
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65909:215"/>I will not do the Protector ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, as to load him with diſhonour; ſince I have been informed, that he would have made our conditions good, if <hi>Crook,</hi> that gave them, had not abjur'd them.</p>
               <p>This is not a time for me to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſubject, ſince I am now become the Subject of death: But ſince the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were drawn by my hand, I thought my ſelf obliged to a particular Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
               <p>I could tell you of ſome ſouldiers which are turned out of his Troop for defending thoſe conditions of ours: but let that paſs; and henceforward, inſtead of life, liberty, and eſtate, (which were the Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon) let drawing, hanging, and quartering, bear the Denomination of Cap. <hi>Crooks</hi> Articles.</p>
               <p>However, I thank the Protector for granting me this honourable death.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now give you an account of my Faith. But truly Gentlemen this poor Nation is rent into ſo many ſeveral opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that it is impoſſible for me to give you mine without diſpleaſing ſome of you. However if a man be ſo criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as to enquire of what faith I die,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65909:216"/>I ſhall refer him to the Apoſtles, <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> &amp; the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of this Reverend Gentleman, Dr. <hi>Short,</hi> to whom I have unboſomed my ſelf: and if this do not ſatisfie, look in the thirty nine Articles of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of <hi>England;</hi> to them I have ſubſcribed, and do own them as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick.</p>
               <p>Having now given you an account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelf; I hold my ſelf obliged in duty to ſome of my friends, to take off a ſuſpition which lies upon them: I mean as to ſome perſons of Honour, which upon my examination, I was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have held correſpondency with. The Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> were the perſons nominated to me. I did then acquit them, and do now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it with this proteſtation, That I never held any correſpondency with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or any of them, in relation to this particular buſineſſe, or indeed to any thing which concern'd the Protector or his Government. As for the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> I ſaw him ſome twelve years ſince, and not later; and if I ſhould ſee him here preſent, I believe I ſhould
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65909:216"/>not know him. And for the Earle of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> he was not a man likely, to whom I ſhould diſcover my thoughts, becauſe he is a man of a contrary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I was examined likewiſe concerning my Brother <hi>Freke,</hi> my Couſin <hi>Hastings,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dorrington,</hi> and others. It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their eſtates may make them liable to this condition: but I do here ſo far acquit them as to give the World this farther proteſtation that I am confident they are as innocent in this buſineſs as the youngeſt child here.</p>
               <p>I have no more to ſay to you now, but to let you know that I am in charity with all men, I thank God I both can, and do forgive my greateſt perſecutors, and all that ever had any hand in my death.</p>
               <p>I have offered the Protector as good ſecurity for my future demeanor as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he could have expected: if he had thought fit to have given me my life, certainly I ſhould not have been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful as to have imployed it againſt him. I do humbly ſubmit to Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, knowing that the iſſues of life and death are in his hand. My blood is but
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65909:217"/>a ſmall ſacrifice, if it had been ſaved, I am ſo much a Gent. as to have given thanks to him that preſerved it; and ſo much a Chriſtian, as to forgive them which take it. But ſeeing God by his providence hath called me to lay it down, I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to it, though terrible to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but bleſſed be my Saviour, who hath taken out the ſting: ſo that I look upon it with terrour. Death is a debt, and a due debt; and it hath pleaſed God to make me ſo good a husband, that I am come to pay it before it is due. I am not aſhamed of the Cauſe for which I die, but rather rejoyce that I am thought worthy to ſuffer in the defence and cauſe of Gods true Church, my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, the liberty of the Subject, and Priviledge of Parliaments. Therefore I hope none of my Aliance and Friends will be aſhamed of it; it is ſo far from pulling down my Family, that I look, upon it as the raiſing of it one ſtory hi he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe unhappy times indeed have been very fatall to my family: two of my
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:65909:217"/>Brothers already ſlain, and my ſelf go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſlaughter: it is Gods will, and I humbly ſubmit to that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>I muſt render an acknowledgement of the great civilities that I have received from this City of <hi>Exon,</hi> and ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality, and for their plentiful proviſion made for the priſoners. I thank Mr. Sheriff for his favour towards us, in particular to my ſelf; and I deſire him to preſent my due reſpects to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and though he had no mercy for my ſelf, yet that he would have reſpect to my family.</p>
               <p>I am now ſtripping off my clothes to fight a duel with death, (I conceive no other duel lawful) but my Saviour hath pulled out the ſting of this mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by making himſelf a ſacrifice for me: And truly I do not think that man deſerving one drop of his bloud, that will not ſpend all for him in ſo good a cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Truth is Gentlemen, in this Age, Trea on is an <hi>individium vagum,</hi> like the wind in the Goſpel, it bloweth wher it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: So now Treaſon is what they pleaſe, &amp;
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65909:218"/>lighteth upon whom they will. Indeed no man, except he will be a Traytor can avoid this Cenſure of Treaſon. I know not to what end it may come, but I pray God my own, and my Brothers blood that is now to die with me, may be the laſt upon this ſcore.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, you may ſee what a condition you are in without a King: you have no law to protect you, no rule to walke by; when you perform your duty to God, your King and Country you diſpleaſe the Arbitrary power now ſet up; (I cannot call it government.) I ſhall leave you to peruſe my tryal, and there you ſhall ſee what a condition this poor Nation is brought into; and (no queſtion) will be utterly deſtroyed, if not reſtored (by loyal Subjects) to its old and glorious Government. I pray God he lay not his Judgements upon <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for their ſluggiſhneſs in doing their duty, and readineſs to put their hands in their boſoms, or rather taking part with the Enemy of Truth. The Lord open their eyes, that they may be no longer lead, or drawn into ſuch ſnares: elſe the Child that is unborn will curſe the day of their Parents birth.</p>

            <p>THis was the laſt Act of <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Tragedies; Death putting ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a period to his Uſurpation, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizing other mens fate with his own, his life had been attended, and his hours meaſured with ſtillation of blood; now they were determined: this full pomp of ſlaughter went before, and uſhered his long deſired Funerals to his uſurped Grace.</p>
            <p>He never ſtirt'd a Plot, but money ſtuck at the bottom. He had an Army of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> which without conſtant pay could never be kept at his beck and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and all the deſign he practiſed could not raiſe him money without the tricks of Jealouſies and Fears; that State-Device, ſerving by fondneſs and force to bring in mony for the Cauſe from the beginning to the very ending; and this was the original of this horrid Plot.</p>
            <p>For nothing elſe can be made out; he had lately ſo frighted all men by his known intelligence at the Kings Court,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65909:221"/>that none but mad-men, except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Tyrannie were altered, would venture upon any new Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; the Uſurper being ſtronger and farther ſeated in his Domination then ever before, and the ſeverity of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt thoſe whom he took in ſuch practices was ſo freſh and recent in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that nothing but Deſperation could thruſt men upon ſuch Pikes.</p>
            <p>Therefore ho had recourſe to his old Artifices, and becauſe no body would be dealing with him, he would be dealing with others, to make the people believe and apprehend danger, and afterwards pay for the delivery from, (that is to ſay, for the perpetration of) it.</p>
            <p>The Deſign was laid in all quarters, <hi>North, Eaſt, West</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> but centred in the City of <hi>London;</hi> 'twas a General Conbination betwixt him and his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The firſt man that was produced in this Plot (which was to ſubvert the Uſurpation, till the Tyrant introduce and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65909:222"/>reſtore our Sovereign, with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar kind reference to the City, which ſhould be fired (by its former Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaties) was Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> a Gentleman of a very Noble Family in <hi>York ſhire,</hi> of an ample and large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue and Eſtate in <hi>York ſhire,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted and waſted in the Kings Service, and afterwards wholly ſequeſtred for the Parliament.</p>
            <p>This Knight, for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been a priſoner in <hi>Hull,</hi> in order to the ſecurity of the Peace, as their Tyrannie termed it, but for many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeares together no ſtranger to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meurances. In that Garriſon he became acquainted, as the ſolace of miſery, and life neceſſirated him, with ſome of the Officers; they likewiſe inſinuating and ingratiating with him, but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, when inſtructions were given them of trapanning him into ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, againſt their Sultan <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This engaged them into a nearer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſiarity, Sir <hi>Henry's</hi> caſe and hard uſage is lamented, the ſtate of the Kingdome laid open, and the oppreſſion of the people aggravated, with many the like overtures, to feel if the pulſe
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65909:222"/>of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> would beat an Alarm to an inſurrection, which for their part truly they feared, but ſhould not draw a Sword againſt any, who ſhould ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the regaining and recovery of their liberty.</p>
            <p>To theſe Diſcoveries Sir <hi>Henry</hi> gave ſome pleaſant, but not ſerious eare, though he did not utterly disbelieve the diſcontents of thoſe men: knowing, if it was abſolute truth they ſpoke, and might in time be accompliſhed, and therefore let fall ſome words tending to that purpoſe; on which they replying, and profeſſing their ſerious ſervice to the King if occaſion preſented it; drew ſome further matter from Sir <hi>Henry;</hi> which was, the offering of a Commisſion to them to ſecure that place for the King.</p>
            <p>This was an old Commisſion, and which had lain by him a long while: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The producing of this Commisſion was enough for their Tyrants ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65909:223"/>who ſtraight gave Order that he ſhould be ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> who after ſome Examination, he was ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and finally brought before a <hi>High Court of Justice,</hi> where he manifeſted the Juggle by which he was brought into the ſnare; and demonſtrated the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posſibility of his doing any prejudice to the State, but that was no Argument there; ſo that he was ſentenced to be beheaded, by vertue of a late Act of one of <hi>Olivers</hi> Conventions, whereby it was made Treaſon to hold intelligence with the Kings Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Much application was made to ſave his life by the Lord <hi>Viſcount Faucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> his Nephew, who had lately mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one of the Uſurpers Daughters; but as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſaid at the Scaffold, he was inexorable; the truth is, the Tyrant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that his not ſparing a perſon ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him, would make all the World believe there was a reality of ſome horrid deſign, which could not be diſpenſed with, without extream danger to the publique.</p>

                  <hi>He did confeſs that he did deliver a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (as it was charged againſt him:) But ſaid, that it was an old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and what he meant was well known to himſelf; but what conſtruction others had made of it, might appear by his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He dſcovered little ſenſe of ſorrow, or fear of Death; but ſaid, <hi>He was ready to ſubmit,</hi> or words to like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Then he addreſſed himſelf to private prayer again; and kneeling down to the Block, he prayed privately for a ſhort ſpace: Then laid his head upon the Block, and at the ſign given, the Executioner ſevered His Head from his Body at one Blow: And his Friends put his Body into a Coffin, and removed it into a cloſe Coach prepared neer the place.</p>

               <p>THis Venerable <hi>Doctor</hi> was next brought upon the Stage, and baited to Death by their Belial <hi>Preſident Liſle.</hi> His objected Crimes, were for conſpiring againſt the Government, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and holding intelligence with the King, branched out into ſeveral Articles.</p>
               <p>After the Charge exhibited, he demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Jurisdiction, citing divers Law-Caſes and Preſidents to back the Reaſons he alledged againſt their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but withal, prayed the <hi>Court</hi> he might not be taken upon the nicety &amp; punctilio of their Law; &amp; that, if they would pleaſe to evince the legality of their <hi>Court</hi> to him, he would inſtantly plead to his Charge, and leave himſelf to them.</p>
               <p>While he thus diſputed with them, they took advantage of three times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Plea, after which they would not admit of it, though he thrice petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, that they would pleaſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof; but it ſeems they were more contented without it, being not able to prove their Charge, their Witneſſes failing them, as it appeared after wards in
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65909:225"/>other mens caſes, whom they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>They were alſo the more peremptory and untractable to this reverent perſon, becauſe of his great Eſteem and Abilities, which he had a long while employed at St. <hi>Gregories</hi> in the ſervice of this <hi>Church, King,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> whoſe cauſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not to plead in the worſt of thoſe times, till he was taken from his Miniſtry by the Tyrant, and his Eloquent Tongue ſilenced in the Grave.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Cromwel</hi> had any particular malice to any perſon, in the contrivance of their death, this good <hi>Doctor</hi> was one, whom he upbraided with railing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming language at his Examination before him, as may appear in the <hi>Doctor's</hi> Speech on the Scaffold, to which we refer the Reader, and with the reſt of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-light, now expiring, bring him down to his Monument. He prayed very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently &amp; earneſtly for the ſpace of almoſt half an hour, and then ſealed his <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> by having his head ſevered from his body with much <hi>Christian</hi> Magnanimity; where we leave him, till his appearance with the Lamb, with his <hi>white Robes,</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>

                  <hi>The Horrid Execution of the reverend Doctor</hi> John Hewyt <hi>D. D. on the ſame Scaffold, on Tueſday the ſame</hi> 8. <hi>of</hi> June 1658. <hi>with his ſpeech before his Death.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS ſoon as Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi>'s body was removed, as is aforeſaid. Dr. <hi>Hewyt</hi> was brought upon the Scaffold, whether being come (together with Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Warmſtry,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barwick</hi>) he fell upon his knees, and prayed private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour; After that he prayed audibly for a good ſpace.</p>
               <p>After which prayer he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the people in a ſpeech which continued above the ſpace of an hour, the ſubſtance of which ſpeech was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</p>
               <p>I am now become a publick Spectacle to Men and Angels (I hope) God, who is Omniſcient, is now beholding me with much pity, and great mercy and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and the more, becauſe I am now come to that end that his own Son came into the world to, To bear witneſs to the truth: he himſelf ſaid, <hi>For this end was I born, for this cauſe came I into the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65909:226"/>world, that I ſhould bear witneſs to the Truth:</hi> I was brought into the world (the Chriſtian world) for to bear witneſs to the truth of the Goſpel, as a common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; I was brought into the world (the Church) as a Miniſter of his bleſſed Word and Sacraments; [Bleſſed be his name for that great honour and dignity] and I came into the world to die more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for the teſtimony of JESUS, which God hath now called me to. I came into this world (this Common-wealth) to be a member thereof, to bear witneſſe to the truths of the Cuſtomes, the Laws, the Liberties, and Priviledges thereof, So I am a member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? And me thinks it ſeems to me a ſtrange thing, that in as much as we all plead for Liberty, and Priviledges, and I pleading for the Priviledges, the Laws, the Statutes, and the Cuſtomes of this Land, yet I ſhould die by thoſe that ſhould ſtand for the Laws, the Statutes, and Priviledges of the Land: And I am here beheld by thoſe that plead for their Liberties, and I hope I am pitied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I here give up my ſelf willingly and freely to be a State Martyr for the publick good; and I had rather die many
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65909:226"/>deaths my ſelf, than betray my fellow freemen to ſo many inconvences, that they might be like to ſuffer by being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the wills of them that willed me to this death.</p>
               <p>And it is worthy remembrance, that Mr. <hi>Solicitor</hi> having impeached me of Treaſon to the Commiſſioners of the Court againſt his Highneſſe, I did often (when brought before thoſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners) plead for the Liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> though I had not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law, yet I had inſtruction from thoſe that were learned in the Law, and had ſeveral Law-Caſes and preſidents put into my hand, though not by them, and urged ſeveral Law-Caſes, and made my Appeal, Firſt for the Judicature that I was to be tryed by, whether it were according to Law? whether it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act? and whether it were according to the words of the ſaid Act? I did appeal to have the ſaid Act argued by learned Lawyers on both ſides, and then to be reſolved by his Highneſſe own Councel, which was denyed me, [This by the by] I preſſing the Argument made a ſecond appeal, that thoſe Judges, if they would give ſingly their ſeveral judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65909:227"/>that it was a juſt and lawfull Court of Judicature, I would anſwer to my Charge, I did make another Appeal to thoſe that were his Highneſs's Council, and pleaded againſt me. That if they would deliver it to me under their hands to be according to Law I would then go on to plead and anſwer to the Charge. What was then ſaid further, my ſpirits being faint, I ſhall not ſay much, but only this, I was taken in three defaults, upon formality of the Court: It ſeems it is a cuſtome in all Courts, (which I did not know before) that if they anſwer not the third time, ſpeaking by the Clerk, that then they are guilty of three defaults, and proceeded againſt as mute: [I had no ſuch knowledge of the Law.] So they found me guilty of thoſe defaults; and when I would have pleaded, and reſolved to begin to plead, I was taken from the Bar. I did the next day make my Petition to the Court in the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-Chamber, two Petitions were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſame in effect; the former the Title was miſtaken: Yet becauſe the title was miſtaken, and no anſwer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therefore it was that another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was drawn up to the ſame effect,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65909:227"/>with a new Title given, (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) preſented by the Serjeant at arms, and one writ it over in ſuch haſt, leſt they ſhould be drawn out of the Painted-Chamber into the Court, that I had not time to read it over, only I ſubſcribed my name, and there was in the front of the Petition a word left out, but what the word was I know not; and this was taken ſo ill, as if I had put an affront or contempt upon the Court; And it was thought they would have heard me plead; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that miſtake, they ſent word, I ſhould have my anſwer when I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court; and my anſwer was the ſentence of condemnation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray with all my ſonl, that God would forgive all thoſe that occaſioned the charge to be drawn againſt me: to give ſuch unjuſt things againſt me: I pray with all my ſoul, that God would forgive all thoſe upon ſo ſlender and ſmall, grounds adjudg'd me to die, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſuch ſimple ignorance as I was in. And I had at the very beginning of my pleading engaged their honours, no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſhould be taken againſt me to my prejudice, that in as much as I underſtood nothing of the Law, And having heard
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:65909:228"/>that a man in the nicety of the Law might be loſt in the ſeverity thereof, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſpeaking a word out of ſimple ignorance, I made it my prayer to them, that no advantage might be taken againſt me to the prejudice of my perſon; and there was to me a ſeeming conſent; for the Preſident told me, there ſhould be no advantage taken againſt me; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conſiderations I am afraid there was too great uncharitableneſs. But I pray God forgive them from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my ſoul, and I deſire that even thoſe that ſhed my blood, may have the bowels of the God of mercy ſhed for them.</p>
               <p>And now having given you the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my coming hit her, it is fit I ſhould give you ſomewhat as concerning my ſelf, as I am a Chriſtian, and as I am a Clergy-man. Firſt, as I am a Chriſtian, I thank God I was baptized to the holy Church, ſo I was baptized to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the holy Catholique Church, that is the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I dare ſay for purity of Doctrine, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Diſcipline, till a ſad reformation had ſpoiled the face of the Church, and made it a query, whether it were a Church, or no? I ſay it was more pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65909:228"/>Divine and Apoſtolical, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine or Church in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, whether National, or Claſſical, or Congregational: And I muſt tell you That as I am a Member of this Church, ſo I am a Member of the holy Catholick Church, &amp; ſhall give a moſt juſt confeſſion of my Faith, both negatively and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. Negatively, I am ſo a Member of the Catholick Church, that I abhor all Sects, Schiſms, Sedition, and Tyranny in Religion. Affirmatively ſo, that as I hold Communion with, ſo I love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all Chriſtians in the world, that love the ſame Lord JESUS in ſincerity, and call on his Name, agreeing with thoſe truths that are abſolutely neceſſary, and clearly demonſtrated in the Word of God, both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though in charity diſſenting from ſome others, that are not neceſſary. And I, as I am thus a Chriſtian, I hope for ſalvation through the Merits of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, his blood I relie on, his merits I truſt to for the ſalvation of my own ſoul: though to this Faith good Works are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; not meritorious in us, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made meritorious by Chriſt his death, by his alſufficiency, by his ſatisfaction,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65909:229"/>and his righteouſneſs, they become meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, but in us they are no other than as defiled Rags. And truly, as I am a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, ſo I told you I was a Member of this Community, and ſo pleaded for the Liberties and Priviledges thereof. I muſt now anſwer ſomething I am aſperſed withal in the World.</p>
               <p>They talk of ſomething of a Plot, and a Treaſonable deſign, and that I had a great intereſt in the knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thereof, and that, for the ſaving my life, I would have diſcovered and betrayed I cannot tell what. I hope my converſation hath not been ſuch here in this City, where I have been a long time very well known, as to make one imagine I ſhould intermedle in ſuch an action, and go ſo contrary to the practice of my profeſſion: and I hope there are none ſo uncharitable towards me, as to believe I had a knowledge of that deſign.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt come to particulars for a Plot, of having a deſign upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the firing of it. I ſo much tremble at the thought of the thing, that ſhould have been done, as they ſay, for the carrying on of ſuch a deſign, (if my heart deceive me not) had I known it,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65909:229"/>I ſo much abhorre the thing, I ſhould have been the firſt diſcoverer of it: Nor ever had I had correſpondency or meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with ſuch perſons as would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on ſuch a deſign. It is ſaid likewiſe I entertained the Earl, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond:</hi> To my remembrance I never ſaw the face of that honourable perſon in my life. It is ſaid, one Lords day I did preach at Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the next Lords day I was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> and kiſt the Kings hand, and brought I cannot tell what Orders and Inſtructions from him. This I ſhall ſay, For theſe three years laſt paſt together, I have not been ſixty miles from this City of <hi>London,</hi> and I think it is ſomewhat further to either of thoſe places than threeſcore miles. It is ſaid that I kept correſpondency with one <hi>Mallory</hi> and <hi>Biſhop:</hi> They are perſons I have heard of their names; but never ſaw their faces: and to my knowledge I do not know they know me: nor do I know them at all, but only as I have heard of their names. And whoſoever elſe hath ſuggeſted ſuch things againſt me, I know not.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe was pleaſed to tell me, I was like a flaming Torch in the midſt of a
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65909:230"/>ſheaf of Corn: He meaning, I being a publick Preacher, was able to ſet the City on fire by ſedition and combuſtions, and promoting deſignes. Here truly I do ſay, and have it from many of thoſe who are Judges of the High-Court, that upon examination of the buſineſs they have not found me a medler at all in theſe Affairs. And truly I muſt needs ſay therefore, That it was a very uncharitable act in them (whoever they were) that brought ſuch accuſation againſt me, and irritated his Highneſs, againſt me. I will not ſay it was malice, it might be zeal, but it was raſh zeal which cauſed me to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced to this place: The God of mercy pardon and forgive them all. And truly as I am a Member of the Church, and as a member of Community where on behalf I have been ſpeaking, I cannot but do as our Saviour himſelf did for his Diſciples, when he was to be taken from them, he bleſſed them, and aſcended up to heaven. My truſt is, in the mercy of the moſt High I ſhall not miſcarry; and however my daies are ſhortned by this unexpected doom, and ſhall he brought untimely to the Grave I cannot go without my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for a bleſſing upon all the people of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65909:230"/>this land, and cannot but bleſſe them all in the name of God, and beſeech God to bleſſe them all, the bleſſing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty be upon them.</p>

            <p>THeſe perſons being all Arraigned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the ſame <hi>High Court,</hi> with four more, being concerned in one Sentence, and one pretended Crime, I have put together, and briefly will give you an account of them.</p>
            <p>They were charged to have conſpired the raiſing of a new War, the firing of the City, and the Death of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to which they all pleaded not guilty, as all the World did judge them, who ſenſibly underſtood the deteſtable practice againſt them.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Aſhton</hi> was then a priſoner for Debt in <hi>Newgate,</hi> but by the Keepers favour, having liberty to go abroad, one day fell into Company with ſome of <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Trapan's: who finding, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps knowing him to be a Cavalier, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65909:231"/>in his Audience, ſuch dangerous words as thoſe, and without amy more ado delated him to the Secretary, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious and partaker to the deſign, which was all his guilt, as he juſtified it upon his Death, which he ſuffered in <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> by being hanged, drawn and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rered, where he declared his Loyalty to the King; but took it upon his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation, he was innocent of any the Crimes charged againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Bettely</hi> ſuffered next, being brought from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> in the ſame Sledge that drew Colonel <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> from <hi>Nawgate;</hi> (their Executions being divided into ſeveral quarters of the City, as their pretended Plot was of firing it: the old Cheat, of picking out places to attend the guilt, and to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue with the City, by the diſſembled care thereof) and near the Croſſe Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the ſame manner, where he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proteſted his Innocency, being meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betrayed by thoſe Ruffian <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> of <hi>Cromwels.</hi> After he had hung a long while, that every one concluded him dead, in a ſtrange miraculous way, as might ſerve to the confuſion of his Blood-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Enemies, he pulled off his Cap, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65909:231"/>held it in both hands, ſtaring with his eyes as if alive: but the Executioner quickly after diſpatcht him, and concluded his Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Stacy</hi> was hanged onely two dayes after, where he ſaid the like, and ſuffered with patience the loſſe of this temporal, to enjoy with unſpeakable happineſſe Life Everlaſting.</p>
            <p>The others Were Reprieved, and by the Death of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> ſoon after ſet at Liberty, which was conſummated at the Reſtauration of his Sacred Majeſty, whoſe benign Rayes of Peace and Security, have dryed up all our Teares of ſorrow and mourning into Teares of Joy, and is leaving us to forget our paſt miſeries, and loſſes of our Liberties, Eſtates, and Relations.</p>

            <p>Judge <hi>Bartlet</hi> who weathered the ſame Storm, being the firſt committed of that reverend Robe, and long ſurvived their high and inſignificant charge and accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; This gives us an Evidence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Juſtice of the Reformers, who would firſt put out the eyes of the Law, that the Subject might ſee the better.</p>

            <p>And here I could make a record of that black Bill and Liſt that paſſed for Acts of

            <p>Laſtly, It were an infinite Task to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize the ſeveral Sequeſtrations, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, and Rapines committed on the Kings good Subjects; the Product of which Spoyles amounted to a vaſt ſum of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and might be ſiſter to the Publick Faith-Money, as Violence and Fraud are ſeldom aſunder.
